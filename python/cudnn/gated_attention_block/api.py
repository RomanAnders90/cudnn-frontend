"""Gated attention block, forward -- projection, QK-norm/RoPE, SDPA, gate, out
projection as one FROST block (bf16 / FP8 / MXFP8, optional MXFP4 weights and fp4 O).

FROST's first MODEL-LEVEL block: a SET of FROST kernels behind ONE API, one
workspace, one call. Every stage is a FROST kernel; there are no cuBLAS or
cuDNN-graph call-outs for the GEMMs (an explicit scoping decision).

Geometry is Qwen3.5's gated attention (provenance in comments only — the shipped
name is by op geometry, per the FROST engine contract § 8).

.. note::

   **MAINTENANCE.** This docstring is the block's design record in the code, and
   it makes claims that stop being true the moment a stage lands or two stages
   merge. Update it in the SAME commit as: any stage becoming real, any fusion
   that deletes a stage or a workspace region, any dtype the block starts to
   serve, and any change to the ``qkvg_offsets`` / :class:`SavedForBackward`
   contracts. A stale design record is worse than none, because it gets trusted.
   The per-stage **Fusion status** paragraphs below are the parts that go stale
   first.

The op graph this file implements, in pipeline order::

**FUSION KNOB (2026-09-11): ``fuse_gate=True`` folds stage (5) into stage (4)'s
epilogue.**  The sigmoid gate is a PRODUCTION feature of the Rubin d256 SDPA
kernels (``sdpa/fwd/kernels/sm107/prefill_d256_{f16,fp8}.py`` behind
``TemplateParams.epilogue_gate``; the engine rows claim it through
``epilogue_gate_d_shapes``): a TMA-staged GATE read + ``O *= sigmoid(GATE)``
after the dead-row select.  ``_Sdpa`` reaches it through the shipped adapter
(``SdpaFwdDslSm100(sample_gate=...)`` / ``execute(gate=...)``) -- the block
owns no SDPA kernel in ANY configuration.  Inference only (no pre-gate ``O``
for ``dG``); composes with ``fuse_norm_rope`` into the 3-launch block
proj(+norm+rope) -> sdpa(+gate) -> out_proj.

**FUSION KNOB (2026-09-11): ``fuse_norm_rope=True`` folds stages (2)+(3) into
stage (1)'s epilogue** (``_FusedQkvProjection`` over the fork
``kernels/proj_gemm_norm_rope.py``): Q/K tiles are normed + rotated on the fp32
accumulator and the slab is written once. Inference / in-place only (no
``q_pre``); OFF by default until the perf node ranks it.

**STATUS (2026-09-11): every stage is REAL.** The two projections drive the
shipped FROST GEMM, stages (2)+(3) are one FROST kernel of this block's own,
stage (4) is the shipped FROST SDPA, stage (5) is this block's elementwise
kernel. Two OPTIONAL fusions, both off by default until the perf node ranks
them: ``fuse_norm_rope`` (stages (2)+(3) into (1)'s epilogue) and ``fuse_gate``
(stage (5) into (4)'s epilogue); with both on the block is THREE launches,
``proj(+norm+rope) -> sdpa(+gate) -> out_proj``. The block targets **Rubin
(SM107) only** for now — every other arch is declined explicitly rather than
served slowly.

**The default pipeline is deliberately UNFUSED**: five stages, five launches
(four under ``inplace_qkv``), every intermediate materialised in the caller's
workspace. That is the honest baseline; it is also the point. Per the design
record, the API boundary is the expensive thing to change later and the
partitioning behind it is cheap, so the stage cuts below move behind knobs
(see "Fusion status" per stage) while this file's signature does not.

Two structural facts that will not move, and that shape everything here:

* **(6) can never share a kernel with (4).** ``o_proj`` contracts over
  ``H_q * D`` — ALL heads — while an SDPA CTA owns one head. Fusing it needs a
  cross-CTA split-K reduction. This is why the block is necessarily a *set* of
  kernels and why the API, not any one kernel, is the deliverable.
* **(5) must run AFTER the SDPA epilogue's dead-row substitution.** A row with
  no unmasked column gets ``O := 0`` by SELECT (``sdpa-invariants.md`` § 2);
  multiplying accumulator residue by ``sigmoid(GATE)`` before that substitution
  propagates NaN. Whenever (5) folds into (4)'s epilogue, it goes after the
  select, never before.

Precision roadmap
-----------------

**bf16 throughout by default** (fp32 accumulate in every GEMM and in the
softmax).  **FP8 (2026-09-11): an E4M3 pipeline with static per-tensor scales
is wired in TWO configurations** -- pass an e4m3 ``h``/weights and a
:class:`QuantSpec`:

* **UNFUSED** (both fusion knobs off; 7 stages = 9 kernel launches, the Q/K/V
  quantize stage being three launches): FP8 projections with the descale
  folded into a scalar-multiply epilogue (bf16 out), bf16 norm+RoPE in place,
  two quantize passes (Q/K/V, then gated O) feeding the Rubin per-tensor FP8
  SDPA and the FP8 out projection.  The quantize passes are the visible price
  of "unfused".
* **FULLY FUSED** (``fuse_norm_rope=True, fuse_gate=True``, 3 launches): the
  projection fork ``kernels/proj_gemm_norm_rope_fp8.py`` descales, norms,
  rotates AND quantizes in its epilogue -- e4m3 Q / K / V into COMPACT
  per-tensor ``q8`` / ``k8`` / ``v8`` (each == compact BSHD ``[B, S, H, d]``,
  exactly what the unfused FP8 SDPA reads), the GATE as bf16 into ``gate16``
  -- and the production FP8 d256 SDPA (``prefill_d256_fp8.py`` with
  ``epilogue_gate`` on and ``has_amax_o=False``: the block runs static scales
  and reads no ``Amax_O``, so the atomic is compiled out) reads those compact
  buffers, multiplies by ``sigmoid(gate16)`` after the dead-row select and
  writes e4m3 ``o8`` for the out projection.  No bf16 slab, no quantize
  passes, no bf16 O: 33792 B/token of workspace against 68608 unfused
  (-51 %).  (Round 1 wrote ONE token-major ``qkv8 [T, n_qkv]`` slab and read
  it STRIDED: measured +7.2 % on the SDPA at 32K -- K/V lines refetched at a
  9216 B stride once the gate stream evicts them -- where compact reads are
  -3.5 %; STATUS.md "SDPA decomposition".  Hence compact per tensor.)  The two
  are NOT bit-identical (the unfused path rounds to bf16 twice); both are
  scored against the fake-quant fp32 oracle.
* Anything in between (one knob) is a typed decline naming both knobs.  The
  FULLY FUSED FP8 pipeline is inference-only; the UNFUSED one trains (see
  "Training under FP8 / MXFP8" below).  FP8 + ``seq_lens_present`` (a dense
  padding mask, incl. an
  EMPTY entry) is SERVED since 2026-09-15: the Rubin FP8 d256 SDPA's
  empty-KV-entry hang is gone (8/8 fresh processes at S=1000 / 512), and the
  block's dead-entry oracle test pins ``out[dead] == 0`` exactly.

**MXFP8 (2026-09-15, PR-B): an E4M3 + per-32-block E8M0 pipeline is wired in
the same TWO configurations** -- pass e4m3 ``h`` / ``W_qkvg`` codes, their
F8_128x4 scale-factor blobs (``sample_h_sf`` / ``sample_w_qkvg_sf`` at
declaration, ``h_sf`` / ``w_qkvg_sf`` at execute) and an :class:`MxQuantSpec`:

* **UNFUSED** (9 stages = 9 kernel launches -- the same launch count as
  unfused FP8, whose 7 stages also issue 9): the block-scale FROST GEMM (``block_scale=True``,
  the E8M0 dequant is exact and happens IN the MMA, so there is no ``alpha``)
  writes the bf16 slab; norm+RoPE in place; THREE ``quantize_mxfp8`` launches
  (Q / K ROWWISE along D, V COLUMNWISE along S -- ``kernels/quantize_mxfp8.py``)
  write compact e4m3 ``q8`` / ``k8`` / ``v8`` + the SDPA's own F8_128x4 SF
  blobs (``sf_q`` / ``sf_k`` / ``sf_v``, one 1 KiB tile per ``(b, h, 128-row
  tile)``; V's is D-PLANE-MAJOR, ``mma-tma-matrix.md`` § 7); the production
  ``sm107/prefill_d256_mxfp8.py`` (``SdpaFwdDslSm100(pertensor_fp8=False)``,
  NATURAL at (256, 256), cga1) writes bf16 O; the bf16 gate; a PER-TENSOR
  ``quantize_o`` (``MxQuantSpec.scale_o``; D1 -- never the rowwise recipe) and
  the per-tensor FP8 ``out_proj`` with ``alpha_o = descale_w_o / scale_o``.
* **FULLY FUSED** (``fuse_norm_rope=True, fuse_gate=True``, 3 launches): the
  MXFP8 GEMM fork twin (``kernels/proj_gemm_norm_rope_mxfp8.py`` via
  ``run_fused_proj_gemm_mxfp8``) norms / rotates / BLOCK-quantizes in its
  epilogue and writes ``q8`` / ``k8`` / ``v8`` + ``sf_q`` / ``sf_k`` / ``sf_v``
  + bf16 ``gate16``; the gated production MXFP8 SDPA writes e4m3 O UNSCALED
  (the kernel has no per-tensor ``scale_o`` -- D8: ``MxQuantSpec.scale_o``
  must be 1.0 on this path, typed decline otherwise); FP8 ``out_proj``.  The
  fork twin is feature-detected on the runner name (``_fork_supports_field``),
  so the typed ``NotImplementedError`` returns only on a checkout without the
  twin -- never a silently un-quantized path.
* Same envelope as FP8: both knobs or neither (the fully fused twin is
  inference-only, the unfused pipeline trains), e4m3 only
  (E5M2 is a typed decline), ``d_model % 128 == 0`` (whole SF atoms along K),
  padding (``seq_lens_present``) served with the same dead-entry contract.

**fp4 (2026-09-17): two modes RIDE the MXFP8 pipeline as appended
:class:`MxQuantSpec` fields** (unrepresentable on :class:`QuantSpec` / bf16
rather than declined); every existing caller and every existing workspace
offset is byte-identical (pinned by a frozen layout snapshot):

* **MXFP4 weights** (``w_qkvg_dtype=torch.float4_e2m1fn_x2``): ``W_qkvg``
  arrives as packed e2m1 codes ``[n_qkvg, d_model // 2]`` (two per byte, LOW
  nibble = even k; the STORAGE shape is what ``check_support`` checks) with the
  UNCHANGED E8M0 / 32 ``w_qkvg_sf``; stage (1) runs the FROST catalog's MIXED
  block-scale row (``fp8_e4m3 x fp4_e2m1``, E8M0 per 32 on both sides) --
  the same 9 launches, no new stage, no new slot.  UNFUSED only: the fused
  MXFP8 projection fork is rendered for an e4m3 B, so ``fuse_norm_rope`` with
  an e2m1 ``W_qkvg`` is a feature-detected typed ``NotImplementedError``
  (``NormRopeFusionParams.weight_fp4``), inverting the day the arm lands.
* **fp4 O** (``o_fp4=Fp4Format.NVFP4 | Fp4Format.MXFP4``; ONE enum member =
  e2m1 codes x scale dtype x block, e4m3 / 16 or E8M0 / 32, so an illegal
  pairing cannot be spelled): the per-tensor tail (``quantize_o`` +
  ``alpha_o`` FP8 ``out_proj``) is replaced by ``kernels/quantize_fp4.py``
  (bf16 gated O -> e2m1 codes ``o4`` + the out-projection GEMM's PADDED
  F8_128x4 blob ``sf_o``, sized by ``proj_gemm.sf_blob_bytes`` -- the GEMM
  contract, never the SDPA's ``_sf_slot_bytes``) and the fp4 x fp4
  block-scale ``out_proj`` against an e2m1 ``W_o`` ``[d_model, H_q*D // 2]``
  of the SAME format with its blob ``sample_w_o_sf`` / ``w_o_sf`` (appended
  arguments, required iff ``o_fp4``, refused otherwise).  No per-tensor scale
  on either side: ``scale_o`` and ``descale_w_o`` MUST be 1.0 (typed
  ``ValueError`` -- the block-scale GEMM has no alpha to carry them).
  UNFUSED: still 9 launches (``quantize_fp4_o`` in ``quantize_o``'s place);
  FULLY FUSED: **4 launches** -- the gated MXFP8 SDPA writes **bf16** O
  (``sdpa_o_dtype = act``; no SDPA ``Capabilities`` change, so the
  support-matrix tracker is untouched), then the fp4 quantize, then the fp4
  ``out_proj``.  Workspace: ``o8`` is not reserved (-1); ``o4`` / ``sf_o`` are
  appended at the END of the arm.  ``d_head % (4 * block) == 0`` (whole
  4-block scale words per head; d=256 passes both formats), else a typed
  ``NotImplementedError``.  A dead ragged entry quantizes to codes 0 exactly
  (NVFP4 scale = the ``2^-9`` e4m3 floor, MXFP4 scale byte ``0x00``).
* Both compose (row 9: the mixed GEMM at (1), the fp4 tail at (5q')/(6')); both
  are inference-only (``save_for_backward`` is a typed decline for the fp4
  modes: the block's training dtypes are bf16 / fp16 / FP8 / MXFP8, and no
  fp4 backward GEMM row exists).  NOT served: an fp4 ``h``, an fp4 ``W_o`` against
  an e4m3 O, e4m3 scales at block 32 / E8M0 at block 16, a global (per-tensor)
  scale on either fp4 side.

**Training under FP8 / MXFP8 (2026-10-01): the UNFUSED quantized pipelines
write the bf16 training record.**  ``save_for_backward=True`` with a
:class:`QuantSpec` / :class:`MxQuantSpec` runs the same 9 launches as the
quantized inference forward and writes the SAME :class:`SavedForBackward` the
bf16 training forward writes -- the bf16 slab (stage (1)'s dequantized product)
with PRE-norm Q/K bands, the bf16 pre-gate ``O``, the exact fp32 LSE,
``rstd_q`` / ``rstd_k`` -- with ``h`` the caller's e4m3 codes (``h_sf`` is a
forward input the record never carries).  What differs from quantized
inference is ONE routing: norm+RoPE writes the normed Q/K OUT of place into
compact bf16 workspace slots (``q`` / ``k``, +17 KiB/token at the 397B
geometry) instead of back over the slab, so the slab's Q/K columns stay
pre-norm for the record, and the quantize stages read those slots.  The hazard
this guards: the inference pipeline norms IN PLACE, so lifting the training
decline without the slots would hand the backward POST-norm bands that it
differentiates as pre-norm -- wrong ``dQ``-side gradients and norm-weight
gradients, no crash, and ``out`` still bitwise the inference block's.  ``out``,
``O``, ``LSE`` and the GATE / V bands are bitwise the inference forward's (same
kernels, different buffers).  The FULLY FUSED quantized pipelines (no slab,
e4m3 ``O``) stay behind the fusion knobs' own training guards and the fp4 modes
are a typed decline.  The bf16 backward consumes this record given the
dequantized bf16 ``h`` and weights (``test_block_backward.py``); the native
fp8 / mxfp8 backward is the follow-up.

Three facts the MXFP8 design rests on, kept here because a port will drop them:

* V is quantized COLUMNWISE for the BMM2, and its MXFP8 scale factors are
  D-PLANE-MAJOR in GMEM while Q/K's are per-tile contiguous -- reusing one SF
  layout for all three is a silent wrong answer that only shows up at
  ``d > 128`` and ``S > TILE_N`` (``mma-tma-matrix.md`` § 7).  The SF-order
  S-sweep in ``test_block_mxfp8.py`` is the detector.
* ``TILE_K_HW`` / idesc ``k_dim`` are **arch-opposite** for FP8: Blackwell wants
  ``k_dim=0`` at ``TILE_K_HW=32``, Rubin ``k_dim=1`` at 64. Read
  ``mma-tma-matrix.md`` § 1 before picking either.
* the RMSNorm in stage (2) and the sigmoid in stage (5) stay fp32-compute
  regardless of the storage dtype.

Public signatures grow APPEND-ONLY (a ``QuantSpec`` argument lands at the end of
the argument list with a ``None`` default), so nothing below needs a placeholder
field today.

Design record (fusion analysis, backward graph, multi-GPU/CP, measurement
protocol): ``frost_dev/plans/qwen_gated_attention_block_plan.md``.
Backward: :mod:`cudnn.gated_attention_block.api_bwd` — read this file first, the
backward is defined against the :class:`SavedForBackward` contract below.
PyTorch oracle and perf baseline:
``test/python/gated_attention_block/cutedsl/reference.py``.

**THD / packed sequences (``thd=True``):** ``h`` / ``cos`` / ``sin`` / ``out``
are PACKED token matrices ``[T, .]`` (or ``[1, T, .]``) holding ``num_sequences``
sequences of at most ``max_seq_len`` tokens each, and ``execute(seq_lens=)``
carries the per-sequence lengths -- ``[B]`` int32 lengths, or ``[B+1]`` int32
prefix sums under ``cu_seqlens=True`` -- for the Q and the KV side alike.  Every
stage but the SDPA is token-wise and runs unchanged over the ``T`` rows; the
SDPA runs the Rubin d256 kernels' varlen arm (packed ``(T, H, D)`` operands, the
lengths read on device, the natural tile order) and writes the head-major packed
LSE ``[1, H_q, T]`` -- the dense record's ``[B, H_q, S]`` at ``B = 1, S = T``, so
the :class:`SavedForBackward` contract is unchanged (``seq_lens`` REQUIRED and
``seq_lens_form`` naming its form).  ``cos`` / ``sin`` are PER-TOKEN tables whose
positions restart at every sequence; the caller packs them.  Served: bf16 / fp16
(inference and training), the UNFUSED per-tensor FP8 pipeline, ``fuse_norm_rope``
for bf16 / fp16 inference, block-sparse attention (``QsaSpec`` with caller lists:
``block_ids`` ``[T, top_k]`` with every id relative to the token's OWN sequence,
the sparse core's packed arm over the same views).  Typed declines: ``fuse_gate``
(the SDPA's epilogue gate has no THD gate descriptor), MXFP8 and the fp4 modes
that ride it (no packed per-sequence scale-factor layout), ``seq_lens_present``
(the two length contracts are mutually exclusive), the in-block indexer and the
paged write-through under ``QsaSpec``.  The lengths are device data, never read on the host:
the caller's contract is every length in ``[0, max_seq_len]`` and
``sum(lengths) == T`` -- the SDPA leaves rows past the live total UNWRITTEN, and
the gate and the backward's weight-gradient GEMMs read every one of the ``T``
rows (a contract violation, not a checked error).  A batch whose sequence count
varies pads with zero-length sequences.

Not in scope for v1, in the order they are likely to land: an MXFP8 (e4m3
block-scaled) O / ``out_proj`` (D1 keeps the e4m3 O per-tensor; the block-scaled
out projection exists only in the fp4 formats above); the graph-API engine row;
the packed-sequence arms of ``fuse_gate`` and of the MXFP8 pipeline. This is a
frontend-only OSS API first; a manifest family + ``Capabilities`` comes when the
stages exist to be honest about.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Stage (1) layout — exactly what the QKV+GATE matmul computes and where it lands
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ONE GEMM, four logical outputs. This section is the contract every other stage
# is written against, so it is spelled out in full rather than left to the
# kernel.
#
# THE GEMM
# --------
#   A  = h        [M, K]   M = B*S, K = d_model      row-major, bf16
#   B  = W_qkvg   [N, K]   N = (2*H_q + 2*H_kv) * D  row-major, bf16   (read transposed)
#   C  =          [M, N]   fp32 accumulate, bf16 epilogue store
#
# i.e. the ordinary ``nn.Linear`` TN form, ``out = h @ W_qkvg.T``. At the 397B
# full-attention layer: M = B*S, N = 17408, K = 4096.
#
# THE N AXIS
# ----------
# N is four contiguous blocks, each head-major with D innermost:
#
#     col   0                  H_q*D            2*H_q*D    +H_kv*D   +H_kv*D
#           |------- Q -------|------ GATE -----|--- K ---|--- V ---|
#   397B:   0                 8192              16384     16896     17408
#           |<--- 32 heads -->|<--- 32 heads --->|<- 2 ->|<- 2 ->|
#
# A geometry that declares block-sparse attention WITH an indexer band
# (``GatedAttentionBlockGeometry.qsa.index_band``) appends a FIFTH block,
# INDEX, below V: ``(index_heads + index_kv_heads) * index_head_dim`` columns
# (640 at the Flash-Next geometry: 4 indexer query heads then 1 raw key head,
# 128 each), so N = 13952 there.  Every geometry without it has exactly the
# four blocks above and the same numbers it always had.
#
# Within a block, head ``j`` owns columns ``[j*D, (j+1)*D)``. Q and GATE are
# adjacent because that is how the model produces them (one double-width
# ``q_proj``), not for any kernel reason.
#
# THE ALIGNMENT INVARIANT, AND WHY IT IS LOAD-BEARING
# --------------------------------------------------
# Every block boundary is a multiple of ``QKVG_TILE_ALIGN`` (64), so for any
# supported ``TILE_N`` **no GEMM output tile ever straddles two blocks**
# (``qkvg_tile_plan`` proves it, ``validate`` enforces it). Consequences:
#
#   * the epilogue can specialize PER BLOCK on a per-tile constant rather than
#     predicating column-by-column -- which is what makes the future
#     quantization epilogue cheap (Q/K rowwise, V columnwise, GATE passthrough,
#     each with its own scale-factor layout);
#   * each block's compact row stride is 16-byte aligned at bf16, so a TMA
#     descriptor over it is legal.
#
# At 397B the boundaries are 8192 / 16384 / 16896, all multiples of 256, so any
# TILE_N in {64, 128, 256} works. The invariant is checked, not assumed: a
# geometry with, say, H_kv*D = 96 raises at build time instead of producing a
# straddling tile nobody notices.
#
# WHERE THE TILES ARE STORED: FOUR COMPACT BUFFERS, NOT ONE FUSED ONE
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# DESIGN RECORD OF THE STAGE-(1) FORK -- NOT what the shipped UNFUSED path does
# (2026-09-29).  Today stage (1) is the unforked FROST GEMM and writes ONE fused
# ``[T, N]`` slab -- the workspace ``proj`` slot, or under ``save_for_backward``
# the caller-owned ``SavedForBackward.proj_slab`` (its bands are the strided
# views ``saved_slab_views`` spells) -- and stage (3b) compacts V out of it.  The
# four-buffer epilogue below is what the fork writes when it lands; the
# reasoning is kept because the fork is still the plan.
#
# The epilogue selects one of FOUR output descriptors from the N-tile index and
# writes a BSHD-COMPACT buffer per block:
#
#     Q     [B, S, H_q,  D]   strides (S*H_q*D,  H_q*D,  D, 1)
#     GATE  [B, S, H_q,  D]   strides (S*H_q*D,  H_q*D,  D, 1)
#     K     [B, S, H_kv, D]   strides (S*H_kv*D, H_kv*D, D, 1)
#     V     [B, S, H_kv, D]   strides (S*H_kv*D, H_kv*D, D, 1)
#
# The tempting alternative -- one fused ``[B, S, N]`` buffer, with Q/K/V as
# strided views -- is REJECTED, and the reason is specific rather than
# aesthetic. Such a view has a padded token stride (N, not H*D). The SDPA's
# dense path accepts that layout (``sdpa/graph_analyzer.dense_layout_ok``
# explicitly allows padded strides). The historical tensor adapter normalized
# layouts outside its direct-binding domain with an implicit gather. Current
# plans bind TMA-compatible strides directly and prepare any required copies
# with explicit scratch; the block still chooses a layout requiring no copies.
# A **gather copy of Q**,
# at 1M tokens is 16 GiB moved twice, silently, inside a block whose whole
# premise is that it does not do that (AGENTS.md Rule 2).
#
# The SDPA's THD arm does address such strides natively -- its own docstring
# names this exact case, "a K/V view of a kv-interleaved [T, 2, H, D] buffer
# ... the layout torch.nn.attention.varlen users produce by slicing a fused KV
# projection" (``api_dsl.py`` ``_thd_check_strides_native``). So the fused-buffer
# layout is reachable, just not on the dense path today. Writing four compact
# buffers gets zero-copy on BOTH arms with no SDPA change, and it is also
# strictly less memory: 17 GiB of Q+GATE+K+V rather than a 34 GiB fused slab
# plus per-tensor copies.
#
# LAYOUT VARIANTS CONSIDERED AND NOT TAKEN (revisit with a measurement, not an
# argument):
#   * **Q/GATE interleaved per head** (``[q_0 g_0 q_1 g_1 ...]``). Still a legal
#     rank-4 view (head stride 2*D), and it is what a fused epilogue would want
#     if one CTA produced a head's Q and its gate together. Buys nothing while
#     the two land in separate buffers anyway, and costs a checkpoint permute.
#   * **K/V interleaved** (``[T, 2, H_kv, D]``). Better KV-tile locality for the
#     SDPA, and a shape the THD path already handles. Worth measuring once the
#     SDPA is the bottleneck; K and V are 1/16 of Q here, so it is a small
#     lever.

# THE CALLER'S SIDE
# -----------------
# ``qkvg_from_hf`` is the documented entry point: it assembles ``W_qkvg`` and
# the two norm weights from a HF Qwen checkpoint's five tensors ONCE, at load
# time, applying the two conventions every Qwen checkpoint from Qwen3-Next on
# shares -- the double-width ``q_proj`` is split PER HEAD (``view(..., H_q,
# 2*D).chunk(2, dim=-1)``), and the QK-norm weight is zero-centered (applied as
# ``1 + w``). ``build_fused_qkvg_weight`` is the layout-explicit assembler
# underneath it. It takes ``q_gate_layout`` because the model's own convention
# for splitting ``q_proj`` is not something to guess: "flat" chunks
# ``[..., 2*H_q*D]`` into all-Q then all-GATE, "per_head" views it as
# ``[..., H_q, 2*D]`` first and chunks the head dim. The two differ by a row
# permutation of ``q_proj.weight``, and picking wrong is a silent wrong answer
# -- so it is a parameter, checked by a round-trip test, never a hot-path
# conversion either way, and an OMITTED layout (which still means "flat")
# raises a ``DeprecationWarning`` rather than guessing silently.

    2048-token budget, block ratio 4, a 4-head x 128 MQA indexer over one raw key head) lives in comments only; the
    fields are named by op geometry.

    Fields
    ------
    block_size
        Tokens per selectable block.  4 only: the sparse loader fetches one 4-token block per gather transaction;
        another block size has no loader.
    top_k
        Blocks per query the caller's list carries: a multiple of 4 in ``[4, 512]``.  It SIZES the kernel's per-query
        index staging (every ids byte count is ``top_k x 4``, copied in 16-byte units), so a longer list would be
        silently truncated and an unaligned one over-read -- both refused by :meth:`validate`.
    index_source
        ``"caller"``: ``execute(block_ids=)`` carries the selection -- ``[T, top_k]`` int32, per query the ids of its
        selected complete blocks (block ``b`` = tokens ``[4b, 4b + 4)`` of the query's own sequence), the valid prefix
        then ``-1`` padding; ``block_lens`` optional.  ``"indexer"``: the block runs the indexer over its fifth band
        itself (``index_band`` required; bf16 activations): the band's query heads are RMSNormed and rotated per token,
        its raw key head is mean-pooled per complete block, RMSNormed and rotated at the block START, and the scorer
        keeps the ``top_k`` blocks per query -- ``execute`` then takes ``w_iq_norm`` / ``w_ik_norm`` and refuses
        ``block_ids``; the selection, its counts and the compressed keys come out through the optional caller buffers
        ``block_ids_out`` / ``block_lens_out`` / ``index_k_compressed``.  At ``S <= identity_bound`` the block launches
        no scorer: the selection is the identity, a plan-time constant (:class:`_Indexer`).
    index_band
        ``W_qkvg`` carries a FIFTH band, ``ProjBlock.INDEX``, of ``(index_heads + index_kv_heads) * index_head_dim``
        columns below V: the indexer's query heads first, its single raw key head last (the checkpoint's own row
        order, so the indexer weight concatenates unchanged).  Served on the UNFUSED projection (the FROST GEMM writes
        the wider slab; :func:`index_k_raw_view` exposes the raw key); the fused projection fork renders 256-column
        tiles and declines a 640-column band, typed.
    index_heads, index_kv_heads, index_head_dim, index_norm_eps
        The indexer's geometry.  Under ``index_source="caller"`` they SIZE THE BAND ONLY (no kernel reads them); under
        ``"indexer"`` they are the scorer's: ``index_heads`` a head group the indexer scorer packs, ``index_head_dim``
        its head dim, ``index_norm_eps`` the epsilon of both indexer RMSNorms (``cudnn.gated_attention_block.qsa_select``
        names the two).  ``index_kv_heads`` is 1 (one raw key head, the checkpoint's own validator pins it);
        ``index_head_dim`` is a multiple of ``QKVG_TILE_ALIGN`` so every indexer head keeps the band tile-aligned.

    Fixed semantics that are deliberately NOT fields: the open tail block is always visible, the causal mask is always
    applied, and the id dtype is int32 (one legal value; an int64 list is refused at ``execute``).  A dense route below
    the identity bound (:attr:`identity_bound` visible tokens -- 2051 at the defaults -- below which every query's
    complete blocks fit the list and a full list reproduces dense causal attention) is a legal performance knob ONLY
    under ``index_source="indexer"``, where the block derives the selection itself; under caller lists it would ignore
    the list: numerics-changing, never a knob.

    :func:`qkvg_from_hf`, which fixes the layout below to the one those
    checkpoints use and also prepares the two norm weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    w_q_gate
        ``q_proj.weight``, ``[2*H_q*D, d_model]`` — the model's double-width
        query projection, holding both Q and the output gate.
    w_k, w_v
        ``k_proj.weight`` / ``v_proj.weight``, ``[H_kv*D, d_model]``.
    q_gate_layout
        How ``w_q_gate``'s rows split into Q and GATE, which is a property of
        the checkpoint and is NOT inferable from the tensor:

        ``"flat"``
            ``[all Q heads | all GATE heads]`` — the split a
            ``chunk(2, dim=-1)`` on the flat ``[..., 2*H_q*D]`` output performs.
        ``"per_head"``
            ``[Q_0 | GATE_0 | Q_1 | GATE_1 | ...]`` — the split a
            ``view(..., H_q, 2*D)`` followed by ``chunk(2, dim=-1)`` performs.

        Get this wrong and every gate is applied to the wrong head: the output
        is finite, plausible, and wrong, with no error anywhere. Verify it
        against the model you are loading rather than trusting a default.

        ``None`` (the default) is DEPRECATED: it still means ``"flat"`` so no
        existing caller changes behaviour, but it raises a
        ``DeprecationWarning`` -- every HF Qwen checkpoint from Qwen3-Next on
        is ``"per_head"`` (``q_proj(x).view(..., H_q, 2*D).chunk(2, dim=-1)``),
        so the silent default was the trap the paragraph above describes.
        Pass the layout explicitly, or load through :func:`qkvg_from_hf`.
    index_qk_proj_weight
        APPENDED.  The indexer projection ``[(index_heads + index_kv_heads) *
        index_head_dim, d_model]`` of a block-sparse layer -- its query heads
        then its raw key head, the checkpoint's own row order -- REQUIRED iff

    **Load time only** -- the three results are what the block reads on every

    conventions every Qwen checkpoint from Qwen3-Next on shares (Qwen3-Next,
    Qwen3.5, the Qwen3.8 family), applied here so the caller cannot get them
    wrong:

    * **The double-width ``q_proj`` is split PER HEAD.** The model computes
      ``q, gate = q_proj(x).view(..., H_q, 2*D).chunk(2, dim=-1)``, so the
      rows of ``q_proj.weight`` are ``[q_0 | gate_0 | q_1 | gate_1 | ...]`` --
      :func:`build_fused_qkvg_weight` with ``q_gate_layout="per_head"``. The
      other layout applies every gate to the wrong head with no error anywhere.
    * **The QK-norm weights are zero-centered.** The model's RMSNorm is
      ``x * rsqrt(mean(x^2) + eps) * (1 + w)`` with ``w`` initialised to zeros,
      while the block multiplies by the ``[D]`` vector it is given. The form
      handed over is DERIVED from the geometry's ``norm_weight_offset`` (0.0
      when the geometry has no such field): at ``0.0`` the block adds nothing,
      so it receives ``(1 + w)``; at ``1.0`` the block's norm kernels add the
      ``1`` themselves in fp32, so it receives ``w`` as is. Deriving it from
      the same geometry the block is declared with is what keeps the two
      mechanisms from composing into ``1 + (1 + w)`` -- finite, plausible,
      wrong -- which is why there is no free-standing argument for it.

    ``(1 + w)`` is formed in fp32 and rounded ONCE into ``act_dtype``. bf16
    has 8 significand bits, so near 1.0 that rounding is at most ``2^-8`` =
    0.39 % relative per channel (``2^-11`` = 0.049 % in f16), and a trained
    ``-2^-9 < w < 2^-8`` rounds to exactly 1.0 (an asymmetric interval: bf16's
    spacing is ``2^-8`` just below 1.0 and ``2^-7`` just above; f16 loses
    ``-2^-12 < w < 2^-11``); a systematic per-channel scale error inside the
    block's accuracy budget but not HF-faithful -- the fp32 in-kernel offset
    form is the faithful one once a geometry declares it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q_proj_weight
        ``q_proj.weight``, ``[2*H_q*D, d_model]`` (Q and the output gate, per head).

        ``k_proj.weight`` / ``v_proj.weight``, ``[H_kv*D, d_model]``.
    q_norm_weight, k_norm_weight
        ``q_norm.weight`` / ``k_norm.weight``, ``[D]``, zero-centered; both
        ``None`` iff ``geometry.qk_norm`` is ``False`` (then the block takes no
        norm weights and ``None`` is returned in their slots).
    geometry
        The block's geometry; also the source of ``norm_weight_offset``.
    index_qk_proj_weight
        The indexer projection ``index_qk_proj.weight`` of a block-sparse layer,

        iff ``geometry.qsa.index_band`` (appended below V as the fifth band of
        ``w_qkvg``, rows as the checkpoint stores them), REFUSED otherwise.
    act_dtype
        The block's ACTIVATION dtype (bf16 by default, f16 also served). All
        three results are returned in it, contiguous. A quantized pipeline
        quantizes the returned ``w_qkvg`` afterwards and keeps the norm weights

# ``i + ROPE_DIM // 2`` -- the NeoX / ``rotate_half`` convention that HF
# ``apply_rotary_pos_emb`` and vLLM's default ``RotaryEmbedding`` use, with the
# halves duplicated so ``cos[..., i] == cos[..., i + ROPE_DIM // 2]``:

#     out   = x_rot * cos + rotate_half(x_rot) * sin
#     where rotate_half(v) = cat(-v[..., H:], v[..., :H]), H = ROPE_DIM // 2
#
# The duplication is redundant (2x a 128 KiB table at S=1K) and kept anyway
# because it makes the tables byte-identical to what a HF or vLLM caller already
# holds -- so no conversion happens on the hot path (Rule 1).
#
# **Taking a TABLE rather than position ids is the load-bearing choice.** mRoPE
# (per-section positions), plain RoPE, YaRN and any NTK scaling all differ only

    """Byte offsets into the caller's workspace, one per materialised tensor.

    ``get_workspace_size()`` must be honest and ``execute()`` must not allocate
    (contract § 10 / Rule 1), so every intermediate is reserved at build time and
    carved as a view at execute time.

    At Qwen3.5-397B, B=1 S=1Mi bf16 these are NOT small: PROJ alone is 34 GiB and
    Q/O are 16 GiB each, while K and V are 1 GiB (GQA is 16x and ``h_kv`` is 2).
    That asymmetry decides both the fusion order here and the context-parallel
    strategy in the design record § 9.2.

    ``-1`` means the tensor never lands in HBM: ``gate`` lives in ``proj``'s
    columns and ``o_gated`` aliases ``o`` (stage (5) gates in place).  Under the
    FULLY FUSED FP8 pipeline ``proj`` and ``o`` are ``-1`` too: the fused
    projection writes the COMPACT e4m3 ``q8`` / ``k8`` / ``v8`` (the same three
    slots the unfused FP8 quantize passes fill) + ``gate16`` (bf16 GATE), and
    the gated FP8 SDPA writes ``o8`` directly.

    Under the TRAINING forward (``_plan_workspace(want_saved=True)``, i.e.
    ``save_for_backward``) the caller's :class:`SavedForBackward` takes two slots
    over: ``o`` is ``-1`` (the SDPA writes the PRE-gate ``saved.o`` directly) and
    ``o_gated`` is RESERVED (stage (5) gates OUT of place into it, stage (6) reads
    it); ``proj`` is ``-1`` in the proj_slab save mode (stage (1) writes
    ``saved.proj_slab``) and reserved as usual in the gate-copy mode
    (``saved_gate_copy``: the GATE band is copied out of it into ``saved.gate``).
    Under a QUANTIZED training forward (FP8 / MXFP8) the bf16 compact ``q`` /
    ``k`` are reserved as well: norm+RoPE writes the normed Q/K there out of
    place (the slab's Q/K bands stay PRE-norm for the record) and the quantize
    stages read them.

    there OUT of place so the slab's Q/K bands stay PRE-norm for the record, and
    the quantize stages read them (+17 KiB/token at the 397B geometry; the
    inference carve is untouched).  ``o`` is NOT reserved (the SDPA writes the
    caller's PRE-gate ``saved.o``) and ``o_gated`` IS (stage (5) gates OUT of
    place into it; stage (6) reads it); ``proj`` is not reserved in the
    proj_slab save mode (stage (1) writes ``saved.proj_slab``) and reserved as

    test_workspace_layout_is_byte_identical_without_want_saved``).

    ``mxfp8`` (appended) adds the three SDPA scale-factor blobs ``sf_q`` /
    ``sf_k`` / ``sf_v`` (:func:`_sf_slot_bytes`) at the END of either layout, so
    every FP8 offset is byte-identical to before MXFP8 existed.

    ``o_fp4`` (appended; an :class:`Fp4Format`) appends ``o4`` (packed e2m1 gated O,
    ``t*h_q*d_head // 2`` bytes) and ``sf_o`` (its padded F8_128x4 blob,
    ``proj_gemm.sf_blob_bytes(t, h_q*d_head, block)`` bytes -- the GEMM contract)
    at the END of either layout and does NOT reserve ``o8`` (a slot never written
    is not reserved); on the fused arm the bf16 ``o`` the gated SDPA then writes
    takes ``o8``'s place.  Every layout with ``o_fp4=None`` is byte-identical to
    before (pinned by ``test_workspace_layout_is_byte_identical_without_fp4``).

    ``qsa_indexer_cand_floats`` (appended; ``None`` = no in-block indexer) appends
    the indexer's five slots (:func:`_qsa_indexer_slots`, the scorer's compact-logits
    scratch sized at that many fp32) at the END of the unfused layout; every layout
    without it is byte-identical to before.

    one leaves a contiguous prefix rather than a hole — forking stage (1) to

    ============ ================= ============ ===================================

    **Two SAVE modes, chosen at declaration** (``GatedAttentionBlockFwd(saved_gate_copy=)``,
    because the workspace carve differs; ``execute`` verifies the record agrees):

    * **proj_slab** (the default): the caller allocates ``proj_slab`` and the
      projection GEMM writes it directly (a per-call pointer bind, zero copies);
      ``gate`` / ``q_pre`` / ``k_pre`` are its column bands -- pass them as
      :func:`saved_slab_views` or leave them ``None`` and let the backward derive
      them.  The whole 34 KiB/token slab is saved (the fastest backward: nothing
      to recompute, and V comes for free), and the workspace loses its own slab.
    * **gate-copy** (``saved_gate_copy=True``): ``proj_slab`` is ``None``, the slab
      stays in the workspace and ONE elementwise launch copies the GATE band into
      the compact ``gate`` (16 KiB/token saved); ``q_pre`` / ``k_pre`` are copied
      too only if the caller passed buffers, else the backward recomputes them
      from ``h`` (``RecomputePolicy.RECOMPUTE_QK_PRE``).

    **This dataclass is the block's one genuinely novel value proposition, and
    the reason to build it even if the first A/B is flat.** ``gate`` is the same
    size as ``o``; saving it roughly doubles the attention activation footprint,
    and recomputing it re-runs half the stage-(1) GEMM. Likewise ``q_pre`` /
    ``k_pre`` are either saved (17 GiB) or recomputed from ``h`` by re-running
    the Q and K slices of the projection. **Both trades are invisible at the op
    level and a decomposed graph cannot make either one** — a block can, and can
    expose them as a knob.

    Do NOT try to reconstruct ``q_pre`` from the normed Q by dividing out
    ``w_q_norm``: it is undefined wherever a norm weight is zero, and it is
    numerically hostile wherever one is small.

    ``o_gated`` is deliberately absent: it is ``o * sigmoid(gate)``, so the
    backward's ``dW_o`` stage recomputes it elementwise from two tensors it
    already holds rather than storing a third 16 GiB copy.

    A field left ``None`` means "recompute me", and the backward decides how
    from :class:`~cudnn.gated_attention_block.api_bwd.RecomputePolicy` --
    with two exceptions.  ``rstd_q`` / ``rstd_k`` are ``None`` iff
    ``geometry.qk_norm`` is False: there is no RMSNorm, stage (B6) does not
    exist, and nothing could recompute them; the forward REQUIRES them to be
    ``None`` in that case (and tensors otherwise), both directions typed.  And
    in the proj_slab save mode ``gate`` / ``q_pre`` / ``k_pre`` left ``None``
    mean "a band of ``proj_slab``" (:func:`saved_slab_views` derives them, no
    recompute) -- the only mode in which ``gate`` may be ``None`` at all.

class QuantSpec:
    """Static per-tensor FP8 scales for the block (inference-style quantization).

    Passing a ``QuantSpec`` (and FP8 ``h`` / weights) selects the FP8 pipeline;
    ``None`` is the bf16/f16 block.  All scales are Python floats fixed at plan
    time -- calibrated offline, like the weights' own scales -- so the execute
    path does NO amax pass and NO host readback; the block materialises them as
    1-element fp32 device tensors ONCE in ``compile()`` (the SDPA adapter does
    the same for its identity descales).

    Conventions (``x_real = x_fp8 * descale``; ``x_fp8 = sat_e4m3(x_real * scale)``):

    ============== ============================================================
    ``descale_h``      dequant multiplier of the FP8 input ``h``
    ``descale_w_qkvg`` dequant multiplier of the FP8 ``W_qkvg``
    ``descale_w_o``    dequant multiplier of the FP8 ``W_o``
    ``scale_q/k/v``    quant scales applied to the bf16 post-norm Q, post-norm K
                       and V before the SDPA; the SDPA receives ``1/scale`` as
                       its descales
    ``scale_o``        quant scale applied to the bf16 gated O before ``out_proj``
    ============== ============================================================

    UNFUSED: the two projections fold ``descale_a * descale_w`` into ONE
    scalar-multiply epilogue of the FROST GEMM (fp32 accumulate, bf16 out), so
    the slab and O stay bf16 and the norm+RoPE and gate kernels run unchanged.
    FULLY FUSED (``fuse_norm_rope=True, fuse_gate=True``): the same scalars ride
    INSIDE the two kernels -- ``alpha_qkvg`` and ``scale_q/k/v`` as one fp32 ``[4]``
    device vector read by the projection fork's epilogue (which writes e4m3
    Q/K/V and a bf16 GATE), ``1/scale_q/k/v`` and ``scale_o`` as the production
    FP8 SDPA's ``descale_q/k/v`` / ``scale_o`` execute tensors (it folds
    ``descale_v * scale_o`` into ``inv_sum`` in-kernel and writes e4m3 O).  Only

class _FusedQkvProjection(_Stage):
    """(1)+(2)+(3) in ONE kernel: the QKV+GATE projection with per-head RMSNorm
    and partial RoPE applied to the Q and K tiles INSIDE the GEMM epilogue.

    **This one IS a fork** -- ``kernels/proj_gemm_norm_rope.py``, the rendered
    shipped GEMM at the block's tile config plus an epilogue arm.  What makes the
    fusion tile-local, and therefore cheap, is the S1 layout contract: at
    ``d_head == 256`` one CTA output tile is exactly one head, so the RMSNorm
    reduction over D is thread-local (one epilogue thread owns one row of the
    tile) and the rotate_half partner sits in the same thread.  No new barrier,
    no new SMEM, no cross-CTA exchange; the kernel docstring has the design.

    It writes the SAME ``[T, N]`` slab the unfused chain norms in place, so the
    SDPA reads it exactly as under ``inplace_qkv`` -- which is why the fused
    path REQUIRES in-place: there is no pre-norm Q/K anywhere.  Training
    (``save_for_backward``) therefore keeps the unfused chain until the fork
    also writes ``q_pre``/``k_pre`` (the same trade every overwriting fusion in
    this block makes; see :class:`SavedForBackward`).  ``rstd`` IS emitted.

    Numerics: the norm runs on the fp32 ACCUMULATOR with one bf16 rounding,
    where the unfused chain norms the bf16-rounded projection -- the fused
    result is the more accurate one, so the oracle is the fp32 reference, never
    bit-identity with the pair.

    Rubin (SM107) only: the fork is a rendering for the sm_107a ``128x256``
    2-CTA config and its dtype constants are baked in -- ONE rendering per
    dtype family.  A different ``d_head`` or ``rope_dim`` the epilogue cannot
    tile is declined here, with the tile constraint in the message, before the
    template is ever loaded.

    **FP8 arm (``quant`` given, e4m3 ``h``/``W_qkvg``):** the second rendering,
    ``kernels/proj_gemm_norm_rope_fp8.py`` (selected by
    ``NormRopeFusionParams.quant_fp8``), whose epilogue also QUANTIZES: Q/K tiles
    are descaled (``alpha_qkvg``), normed + rotated on fp32 and written as e4m3
    (``* scale_q`` / ``* scale_k``) into COMPACT per-tensor ``q8`` / ``k8``
    buffers, V tiles as ``e4m3(alpha * acc * scale_v)`` into ``v8``, GATE tiles
    as bf16 into ``gate16`` -- four TMA-store descriptors, tile class -> buffer
    + column remap (round 2; round 1's single ``qkv8`` slab made the SDPA read
    strided and cost +7.2 % at 32K).  The four scalars ride as ONE fp32 ``[4]``
    device vector ``[alpha_qkvg, scale_q, scale_k, scale_v]`` (``qscal``)
    materialised in :meth:`compile`, read in-kernel -- never module-param floats.
    Inference only (``want_rstd`` must be False).  Launched through
    ``run_fused_proj_gemm_fp8`` (the bf16 runner is not overloaded).

    **MXFP8 arm (``quant`` is an :class:`MxQuantSpec`, e4m3 codes + F8_128x4 SF
    blobs for ``h`` / ``W_qkvg``):** the THIRD rendering, the block-scale twin
    ``kernels/proj_gemm_norm_rope_mxfp8.py`` (``NormRopeFusionParams.quant_mxfp8``;
    PR-B section 3.1), whose epilogue norms / rotates the DEQUANTIZED fp32
    accumulator (the E8M0 dequant happens in the MMA -- no alpha, no qscal) and
    BLOCK-quantizes: Q / K rowwise along D, V columnwise along S, e4m3 codes into
    compact ``q8`` / ``k8`` / ``v8`` and E8M0 scale factors into the SDPA's own
    F8_128x4 blobs ``sf_q`` / ``sf_k`` / ``sf_v`` (Q/K per-tile contiguous, V
    D-plane-major); GATE as bf16 ``gate16``.  Launched through
    ``run_fused_proj_gemm_mxfp8`` (frozen ABI, plan 3.1).  Feature-detected on
    the runner name + the fork file: until slice S6 lands the twin this arm is a
    typed ``NotImplementedError`` at ``check_support``, never a silently
    un-quantized path.  Declines ``S % 128 != 0 and B > 1`` (GEMM M-tiles
    straddle sequences; the unfused path serves it).

class _QkNormRope(_Stage):
    """(2)+(3) per-head RMSNorm over D then partial RoPE, on Q and K, ONE kernel.

    **V is not normed and is not touched here.** Q and K ride one launch over a
    flat row space, so K's 1/16-of-Q traffic costs no second launch and the
    cos/sin tables stay hot across a token's heads.

    Emits ``rstd_q`` / ``rstd_k`` (fp32, one per (token, head)) when the block
    saves for backward — 134 MiB + 8 MiB at 1M tokens, cheap enough that
    recomputing them would be the odd choice.

    Norm and rotation both run in fp32 with a SINGLE rounding at the end. An
    unfused torch chain rounds twice, so this is a slightly different (and more
    accurate) function; the oracle is written to match
    (``reference.qk_norm_rope_reference``).

    **Fusion status: this stage IS the fusion.** Stages (2)+(3) were the
    largest single stage at every sequence length in the torch baseline, which
    is why they were built before the projections. Measured on Rubin at the 397B
    geometry: **18.9x the torch chain, taking the stage from 36-53% of the block
    to 1.5-2.6%** — and **36.7% of a cold 10777 GB/s copy ceiling** at the
    shipped knobs, so there is real headroom left. Being pure bandwidth, the
    harness reports achieved GB/s and fraction-of-ceiling, never TFLOP/s.

    **Quote no fraction for this stage that was not L2-FLUSHED.** The earlier
    "58%" was hot-cache and against another node's ceiling; re-measured cold on
    2026-09-10 it is 36.7%. The kernel docstring carries the full table and the
    register-pressure diagnosis; ``frost_dev/probe_norm_rope_bw.py`` reproduces
    it with hot and cold columns side by side.

    Q/K may be updated IN PLACE (``q_out is q``): every lane reads its whole row
    before any lane stores, and the RoPE partner shuffle stays inside the row's
    own lane group.

    **``geometry.qk_norm=False`` -- RoPE only.** Both kernels fold the RMSNorm
    out at trace time (``compile_qk_norm_rope[_tma](apply_norm=False)``: the
    weight slots are traced as ``None``, exactly the presence switch ``want_rstd``
    uses), so there is no sum-of-squares pass, no rsqrt, no weight load and no
    rstd; the dims ``[rope_dim, d_head)`` come out BIT-EXACT. The stage name and
    position do not change (``"qk_norm_rope"`` stays in ``_stages``); ``execute``
    takes ``None`` for both weights and refuses tensors, both directions typed.

    Kernel: ``kernels/qk_norm_rope.py`` — at ``kernels/`` level, not under an
    arch package, because it is plain vectorized LDG/STG with no tcgen05 and no
    arch-specific path (engine contract § 8).

class _Sdpa(_Stage):
    """(4) ``O = softmax(Q K^T * scale + mask) V``, GQA-broadcast H_q/H_kv.

    **This stage writes no kernel, in ANY configuration.** It drives the shipped
    FROST forward (``cudnn.sdpa.fwd.api_dsl.SdpaFwdDslSm100``), which routes to
    the SM107 sibling kernels automatically from the live device —
    ``rubin=(self._device_cc == (10, 7))`` in ``SdpaFwdDslSm100.compile`` — so the
    ``(256, 256)`` flavor Qwen3.5 needs lands on
    ``sdpa/fwd/kernels/sm107/prefill_d256_f16.py`` (bf16 / f16) or, under
    ``pertensor_fp8=True``, ``prefill_d256_fp8.py`` (e4m3).  There is no flag to
    pass; there IS an arch to check, which :meth:`check_support` does.

    **``fuse_gate=True`` is the SAME adapter with a gate descriptor.**  The
    sigmoid-gate epilogue -- a TMA-staged read of GATE and
    ``O := O * sigmoid(GATE)`` AFTER the dead-row select, per element -- is a
    production feature of both d256 kernels behind
    ``TemplateParams.epilogue_gate`` (``SdpaFwdDslSm100.template_params()``
    sets it from ``sample_gate``; the engine rows claim it through
    ``Capabilities.epilogue_gate_d_shapes``).  Declaring the stage with
    ``sample_gate=<GATE descriptor>`` selects that specialization and
    ``execute(gate=...)`` binds the tensor.  GATE may be a column slice of the
    ``[T, N]`` slab (``gate_token_stride``): the adapter compiles the gate's
    TMA descriptor at the declared stride exactly as it does Q/K/V, so no copy
    happens anywhere -- and stage (5) disappears.

    **MXFP8** (``mxfp8=True``, e4m3 codes + F8_128x4 E8M0 scale factors): the
    SAME adapter with ``pertensor_fp8=False`` -> ``sm107/prefill_d256_mxfp8.py``
    (the production block-scale kernel; the per-tensor fork machinery is gone,
    so nothing can route block-scaled data into the per-tensor kernel).  The
    three SF blobs ride ``execute(sf_q=, sf_k=, sf_v=)`` and are REQUIRED;
    ``descale_q/k/v`` / ``scale_o`` are REFUSED (the adapter would silently
    ignore them -- the E8M0 dequant is in-MMA and a gated e4m3 O is UNSCALED,
    D8).  ``sched_policy`` is read off the MXFP8 row
    (``engine_name(arch, mxfp8=True)``: NATURAL at (256, 256) -- the per-tensor
    row's LPT claim does NOT transfer, D5) and ``cta_mma`` is left to the
    adapter (1 for the quantized d256 flavor).  ``has_amax_o=False`` as under FP8.

    **FP8** (``dtype == e4m3``): ``pertensor_fp8=True``, ``dtype_o`` (bf16 on the
    unfused pipeline, e4m3 on the fully fused one) and ``has_amax_o=False`` --
    the block runs static per-tensor scales and never reads ``Amax_O``, so the
    kernel's atomicMax is compiled out rather than written into a slot nobody
    reads.  ``descale_q/k/v`` and (e4m3 O only) ``scale_o`` ride ``execute``;
    the kernel folds ``descale_v * scale_o`` into ``inv_sum`` in-kernel.  The
    block feeds it COMPACT ``q8`` / ``k8`` / ``v8`` (``token_stride == 0``):
    round 1's strided slab reads cost +7.2 % on the SDPA at 32K -- K/V lines
    refetched at a 9216 B stride once the gate stream evicts them -- where
    compact reads are -3.5 % (STATUS.md "SDPA decomposition").

    Three things settled here rather than inherited:

    * **``sched_policy`` is chosen EXPLICITLY, and it is LPT at d=256 -- bf16
      AND FP8.** `sdpa_fwd_prefill_sm107` (PR #1001) and, since 2026-09-11,
      `sdpa_fwd_prefill_sm107_fp8` advertise ``{NATURAL, LPT}`` for the
      (256, 256) flavor this block uses. ``_sched_policy`` reads the live
      device's row and picks LPT exactly where that row claims it, NATURAL for
      anything else -- gated on the d-shape the row actually claims rather than
      on "is Rubin". Stated rather than left to the standalone wrapper's ``None``
      derivation, which still excludes Rubin wholesale and would quietly give
      the win back.
    * **LSE is optional here and mandatory for training.** Prefill inference
      never reads it, so a stats-less block pays nothing; ``save_for_backward``
      implies it, because the SDPA backward cannot run without it.
    * **Mask arms are ``const_expr``-folded**, so a dense PASS proves nothing
      about the causal/window path. Validate at least one config per arm.

    ``seq_lens`` is the per-batch valid KV length (dense padding mask), or --
    under ``thd=True`` -- the per-sequence PACKED lengths (``[B]`` int32, or
    ``[B+1]`` int32 prefix sums under ``cu_seqlens``), handed to the adapter as
    BOTH ``seq_q_lens`` and ``seq_kv_lens`` (self-attention; the adapter requires
    both under THD).  **THD / varlen is the adapter's own ragged arm**: the stage
    declares the ``(num_sequences, H, max_seq_len, D)`` ENVELOPE at the block's
    token strides (the batch stride is never read -- every sequence base comes
    from the on-device prefix sums), ``thd=True`` with the packed totals ``T``,
    the head-major packed LSE ``[1, H_q, T]`` with head stride exactly ``T``
    (:func:`_thd_lse_desc`) and ``SCHED_NATURAL`` -- the varlen grid is the
    kernel's own persistent claim counter over the live (sequence, q-tile, head)
    units, and the LPT decodes assume a dense rectangular tile space -- and at
    ``execute`` hands RANK-3 packed ``(T, H, D)`` views (a slab column slice at
    token stride ``n_qkvg``, or the compact buffers) that the adapter binds
    without a copy; the dense arm's rank-4 ``(1, H, T, D)`` transpose is REFUSED
    there once more than one sequence runs.  Dense Q-side trimming
    (``seq_q_lens``) is NOT wired -- a decline, not a silent no-op.

        SOL at S = 4096 / 8192 / 32768, recovering 40 / 51 / 29 % of the
        causal-vs-dense gap, and dense-neutral; on the per-tensor FP8 d256 kernel
        +5.2 / +5.9 / +5.6 / +2.0 / +2.3 % at S = 2K..32K (perf node,
        launch-interleaved, O bit-identical to NATURAL).

        rows claim LPT per flavor through `sched_policies_by_d_shape` ((256, 256)
        on both, (192, 128) on FP8), and this picks LPT exactly when the row the
        live device would use has it in the effective domain for (d, d). Asking
        for LPT on another flavor would be asking for something no row claims
        (contract § 4: honoured or ineligible, never substituted). Two copies of
        one fact drift (engine-contract § 8b'), so there is no shape literal

    ``seq_kv_lens`` ``[B]`` when declared.  ``execute`` binds the real views AS THEY ARE -- the adapter's contract is BSHD,
    so unlike :class:`_Sdpa` there is no transpose -- plus the index tensors (a ``[B, S, top_k]`` list is viewed flat: an
    exact view of a contiguous tensor, no copy).  ``block_lens`` is optional PER CALL, so :meth:`compile` builds BOTH
    ``has_block_lens`` variants at plan time and the adapter dispatches on the tensor it is handed (plan-time keys only,
    Rule 4).  The dense kernel carries no GMEM scratch (the count, the tail block and the dead items are derived on
    device), so :meth:`scratch_workspace_bytes` folds 0 into the block's workspace -- a dense ``QsaSpec`` block's workspace
    is the dense block's.

    **THD / packed sequences (``thd=True``)**: the adapter's packed arm (the kernel's persistent claim-counter form).  The
    block is internally ``B = 1, S = T``, and the adapter's packed contract IS that shape -- Q / O ``[1, T, H, D]``, K / V
    ``[1, T, H_kv, D]`` with batch extent 1, the token totals as CAPACITIES -- so ``execute`` binds the very same views the
    dense arm binds (no transpose, no copy; the slab column slice keeps its token stride).  ``execute(seq_lens=)`` is
    REQUIRED and serves BOTH length sides (self-attention): the ``[B]`` int32 lengths or the ``[B+1]`` int32 prefix sums
    (``cu_seqlens=True``), declared as ``seq_q_lens`` / ``seq_kv_lens`` descriptors of exactly that extent and never read
    on the host (the setup launch normalizes them on device).  ``block_ids`` keeps its ``[T, top_k]`` form with every id
    RELATIVE TO ITS SEQUENCE (block ``j`` of sequence ``b`` = its tokens ``[4j, 4j + 4)``); the LSE is the head-major packed
    ``[1, H_q, T]`` the block already carries at ``B = 1``.  The ONE scratch the arm needs -- the adapter's int32 THD
    metadata (``THD_META_WORDS(B)``, 16-byte rounded) -- enters the block's engine arm through
    :meth:`scratch_workspace_bytes` and is handed back at ``execute(workspace=)``.  A one-sequence packing computes the
    dense ``B = 1`` function bitwise; an empty sequence owns no rows.

    Not here (typed declines at the block's declaration, each naming its feature): ``fuse_gate`` -- the sparse core's
    epilogue-gate operand is not bound through this stage yet; ``causal_bottom_right`` -- the decode / verify form; the
    quantized pipelines and training; THD together with the in-block indexer (the scorer reads dense ``[B, S]`` prompts)
    and THD together with the paged write-through.  Each lands by flipping the record, the adapter AND this stage in the
    same change; the declaration decline names the record's state so the flip is visible (``thd`` flipped 2026-10-08).

    gating accumulator residue instead of that zero propagates NaN, and residue
    really can be a NaN bit pattern (``* 0`` is not a fix -- the substitution is
    a SELECT). Under context parallelism a rank can legitimately hold a chunk

    GATE is read as a strided COLUMN SLICE of the fused projection — no repack.
    Under inference O is gated IN PLACE, so ``O_gated`` costs no buffer; under
    training (``save_for_backward``) the SDPA wrote the PRE-gate O into the

    per-query selection stage (4) consumes, derived from the slab's fifth band instead of handed in by the caller.

    **Five launches at ``T <= 4096`` -- two compress, the scorer GEMM, the radix top-k, the row sort -- one more sort window
    per further 4096 rows (:meth:`launches_per_execute`); no kernel of its own.**

    1. The indexer QUERIES -- the band's ``index_heads`` x ``index_head_dim`` query columns of every token, RMSNormed
       (``w_iq_norm``, ``index_norm_eps``) and partially rotated at the token's position -- through the block-compress
       kernel (``kernels/qsa_compress.py``) at ``pool = 1`` over a ``[T, index_heads, index_head_dim]`` view of the slab
       (batch = token, block = head; the tables broadcast over the heads with a zero stride): bitwise the block's own
       norm + RoPE chain on those rows (one fp32 pass, one rounding), written compact into the ``ix_q`` slot.
    2. The COMPRESSED KEYS -- the band's raw key head mean-pooled per complete ``block_size``-token block, RMSNormed
       (``w_ik_norm``) and rotated at the block START position ``block_size * j`` -- the same kernel at
       ``pool = block_size`` over the slab's raw-key column slice (token stride ``n_qkvg``, no copy), into the
       ``ix_kbar`` slot ``[B, floor(S / bs), D_i]`` and, when the caller passes ``index_k_compressed``, into that buffer
       as well (its rows at or past a sequence's complete blocks are never written: a cache sized for a longer context
       keeps them).
    3. The SELECTION -- :func:`qsa_select` (the indexer scorer ``sum_h relu(q_h . kbar_j) / sqrt(D_i)`` over the blocks
       below ``floor((pos + 1) / bs)`` + the fused radix top-k, ties to the smaller id) into ``ix_ids`` / ``ix_scores``:
       ``[T, top_k]`` int32, the ``min(top_k, floor((pos + 1) / bs))`` selected ids then ``-1`` -- exactly the count rule
       the sparse core derives, so stage (4) needs no ``block_lens``.  The top-k's SET is reproducible but its slot order
       is not (the radix pass assigns slots with atomics), and the core accumulates in list order, so
    4. the CANONICAL ORDER -- each row sorted descending (the selected ids descending, the ``-1`` padding last; a
       row-windowed ``torch.sort`` into preallocated workspace slots, no temporaries) into ``ix_ids_sorted`` or the
       caller's ``block_ids_out``: two executes of the block are bitwise, and the list a caller gets back is canonical.

    **The RoPE tables are the attention's own** ``cos`` / ``sin`` ``[B, S, rope_dim]``: the key compress reads row
    ``bs * j`` for block ``j`` (every block start is a position of the prefill), the query norm reads row ``pos``.  No
    table of its own, no position ids; the decode step, whose per-token tables do not reach a block start, carries its
    own table rule in the compress kernel's step form.

    **The identity below the bound.**  At ``S <= QsaSpec.identity_bound`` every query's complete blocks fit the list, so
    the selection is the identity: the block launches NO scorer and NO query norm, hands stage (4) a plan-time constant
    list (``ids[t, j] = j`` below the row's count, ``-1`` past it) and reserves no indexer slot; the key compress runs
    only into a caller's ``index_k_compressed`` (a serving cache wants the prompt's compressed keys whatever its length).

    **Padding rows under ``seq_lens``.**  A query at or past its sequence's KV length scores blocks past the sequence's
    complete ones; the ``ix_kbar`` slot is zero-filled per execute there (one memset, only under ``seq_lens_present``),
    so those blocks score 0 -- a positive visible block always wins, a zero-score tie goes to the smaller (visible) id
    -- and the sparse core masks every key past the length anyway.  The caller's ``index_k_compressed`` is NOT
    zero-filled: its rows past a sequence's blocks are the caller's.

    **What it costs.**  ``ix_q`` ``T x H_i x D_i x 2`` B, ``ix_kbar`` ``B x S / bs x D_i x 2`` B, the list
    ``T x top_k x 8`` B, and the scorer's compact-logits scratch ``~ B x S^2 / (2 bs)`` fp32 (512 MiB per 32K-token
    sequence) -- the price of never materializing the dense ``[T, n_blocks]`` score tensor in one launch pair; a
    row-windowed select bounds it and is the lever for longer prompts.  ``compile`` warms the scorer GEMM and the top-k
    at the real ``(B, S, n_blocks)`` (their compile keys carry the shape) on temporaries of the slot sizes, freed after
    one synchronous run, so ``execute`` compiles nothing and allocates nothing (Rules 1 / 4); the plan-time constants
    (the query prefix, the scratch offsets, the counts, the identity list) are device tensors of the plan.

    Barrier / SMEM tables: the compress kernel has no mbarrier and no SMEM (its module docstring: both tables empty by
    construction); the scorer and the top-k are the DSA kernels with their own suites.  Declines, typed: at declaration
    (:func:`_check_qsa_indexer_geometry`) f16 activations, an ``index_head_dim`` other than the scorer's, an
    ``index_heads`` outside its packed groups, THD, and the CuTe DSL floor as well (ahead of the head-group read, which
    imports the scorer's package); at ``check_support`` the floor again and the ``sm_107a`` target, both before any kernel
    import, and a device outside the scorer's family (cc 10.x).

class GatedAttentionBlockFwd(APIBase):
    """Gated attention block, forward. One call, one workspace, three to five launches.

    No ``Sm1xx`` suffix on the class: arch is a directory axis under ``kernels/``
    and a per-stage dispatch, not part of the user-visible name. A shipped name
    cannot be renamed, so the arch stays out of it.

    **The default pipeline (``inplace_qkv``, no fusion knobs) is FOUR launches;
    the two fusion knobs take it to three**::

        (1) proj         h            -> PROJ [T, N]            FROST GEMM        | fuse_norm_rope: (1)+(2)+(3) in ONE
        (2+3) norm+rope  PROJ[Q],[K]  -> in place  (+rstd)      this block's kernel| launch (the GEMM fork's epilogue)
                         geometry.qk_norm=False: RoPE only -- same stage, same launch, no norm weights (None), no rstd
        (3b) compact     PROJ[V]      -> V_c                    only when inplace_qkv=False
        (4) sdpa         PROJ[Q,K,V]  -> O  (+LSE)              FROST SDPA        | fuse_gate: (4)+(5) in ONE launch
        (5) gate         O, PROJ[G]   -> O in place             this block's kernel| (the SDPA's epilogue_gate)
        (6) out_proj     O            -> out                    FROST GEMM

    Both fusions are inference-only: each overwrites a tensor the backward needs
    (``q_pre``/``k_pre``, pre-gate ``O``) and is declined with ``save_for_backward``.

    **Serving write-through (``paged_kv_page_size > 0``; bf16 / f16 inference)** adds ONE launch
    between (2+3) and (4) -- ``(4w) cache write: PROJ[K], PROJ[V] -> k_cache / v_cache at slot_mapping``
    (and the raw indexer key into ``index_k_raw`` when the geometry declares the band) -- and changes
    nothing stage (4) reads, so ``out`` is bitwise the block's without it.  A declaration ATTRIBUTE:
    ``execute`` then REQUIRES the pools and the slot mapping and refuses them otherwise.

    **Block-sparse attention (``geometry.qsa``, a :class:`QsaSpec`; bf16 / f16 inference, dense ``[B, S, d_model]`` or
    packed ``thd=True``)** swaps stage (4) for the index-list sparse core -- ``(4) sdpa_sparse  PROJ[Q,K,V], block_ids[,
    block_lens] -> O (+LSE)``, ``sdpa/fwd/kernels/sm107/sparse_d256_f16.py`` through its adapter (:class:`_SparseSdpa`) -- at
    the same operands, the same strides and the same launch count; ``execute`` then REQUIRES ``block_ids`` (``[T, top_k]``
    int32: each query's selected 4-token blocks, the open tail block always visible; under ``thd=True`` the ids are relative
    to the token's OWN sequence) and refuses it otherwise.  Every claim of that core is read off the adapter's capabilities
    record, never transcribed; what the core does not serve is a typed decline at declaration (the in-block indexer and the
    paged write-through under ``thd`` among them).

    **MXFP8** (an :class:`MxQuantSpec` + e4m3 codes + F8_128x4 SF blobs for ``h`` /
    ``W_qkvg``), UNFUSED (9 stages = 9 kernel launches)::

        (1)  proj          h8+sf_h, W8+sf_w -> PROJ [T, N] bf16   block-scale FROST GEMM (E8M0 dequant in-MMA, no alpha)
        (2+3) norm+rope    in place (out of place into compact bf16 Q/K under save_for_backward)   this block's kernel
        (3q) quantize x3   PROJ[Q]/[K] rowwise, PROJ[V] columnwise -> q8/k8/v8 + sf_q/sf_k/sf_v   kernels/quantize_mxfp8.py
        (4)  sdpa          q8,k8,v8 + SF -> O bf16                 production prefill_d256_mxfp8.py (NATURAL, cga1)
        (5)  gate          O, PROJ[G] -> O in place                this block's kernel
        (5q) quantize_o    O -> o8 (PER-TENSOR scale_o, D1)        kernels/quantize.py
        (6)  out_proj      o8 -> out (alpha_o = descale_w_o / scale_o)   per-tensor FP8 FROST GEMM

    and FULLY FUSED (``fuse_norm_rope=True, fuse_gate=True``, 3 launches):
    ``proj(+norm+rope+block-quant -> q8/k8/v8 + sf_q/k/v + gate16) -> sdpa(+gate, e4m3 O UNSCALED;
    scale_o must be 1.0, D8) -> out_proj`` (the ``run_fused_proj_gemm_mxfp8`` fork twin is
    feature-detected; a checkout without it gets a typed decline).  Padding (``seq_lens_present``) is served under
    FP8 and MXFP8 like bf16: a dead entry (``seq_lens[b] == 0``) yields ``out[b] == 0`` exactly.

    **MXFP4 W_qkvg** (``MxQuantSpec.w_qkvg_dtype = torch.float4_e2m1fn_x2``: e2m1 codes ``[N, d_model // 2]``,
    two per byte, ``w_qkvg_sf`` unchanged): the SAME nine unfused stages with stage (1) on the mixed
    MXFP8 x MXFP4 block-scale row::

        (1)  proj          h8+sf_h, W4+sf_w -> PROJ [T, N] bf16   block-scale FROST GEMM, mixed row (fp8_e4m3 x fp4_e2m1, E8M0/32)

    UNFUSED only -- ``fuse_norm_rope`` with an e2m1 ``W_qkvg`` is a typed decline (the fork twin is
    rendered for an e4m3 B; feature-detected on ``NormRopeFusionParams.weight_fp4``).

    **fp4 O** (``MxQuantSpec.o_fp4 = Fp4Format.NVFP4 | MXFP4`` + an e2m1 ``W_o`` ``[d_model, H_q*D // 2]``
    with its F8_128x4 blob ``sample_w_o_sf`` / ``w_o_sf``): the per-tensor tail of BOTH MXFP8
    configurations is replaced -- UNFUSED (still 9 launches)::

        (5q') quantize_fp4_o  O bf16 -> o4 [T, H_q*D/2] e2m1 + sf_o (the GEMM's padded blob)   kernels/quantize_fp4.py
        (6')  out_proj        o4, W_o4 -> out                        fp4 x fp4 block-scale FROST GEMM (scales dequant in-MMA, no alpha)

    and FULLY FUSED (4 launches: the gated MXFP8 SDPA writes **bf16** O, then (5q') and (6')).
    ``scale_o`` / ``descale_w_o`` are pinned to 1.0 (no global scale in either format); ``o8`` is not
    reserved, ``o4`` / ``sf_o`` are appended at the end of the workspace arm.  Composes with the MXFP4
    ``W_qkvg`` above on the unfused pipeline (the mixed GEMM at (1), the fp4 tail at (5q') / (6')).

    Stage (3b) exists only because stage (1) is the UNFORKED FROST GEMM, which
    writes one fused ``[T, N]``. Q and K are de-interleaved for FREE by (2+3),
    which already reads and writes them; V is untouched between the projection
    and the SDPA. Stage (3b) makes V compaction explicit and hands compact
    storage to the prepared SDPA plan (Rule 2).
    **Forking stage (1) to write four compact
    buffers (§ 1) deletes (3b) outright**; until then it is the measurable price
    of not having forked, and V is 1/16 of Q so the price is small.

    Under inference ``O_gated`` needs no buffer: stage (5) gates O in place.
    Under training it does.

    **THD / packed sequences (``thd=True, num_sequences=B, max_seq_len=S_max,
    cu_seqlens=``)**: ``h`` / ``cos`` / ``sin`` / ``out`` are ``[T, .]`` (or
    ``[1, T, .]``) token matrices and ``execute(seq_lens=)`` is REQUIRED -- the
    ``[B]`` int32 lengths (or ``[B+1]`` prefix sums) of the packed sequences, read
    on device only.  Internally ``B = 1, S = T``: the same stages, the same
    launches, the same workspace carve as the dense ``B=1, S=T`` block (plus the
    SDPA's small packed-metadata scratch), the same record -- ``saved.lse`` is
    the head-major ``[1, H_q, T]``, ``saved.seq_lens`` the lengths tensor itself,
    ``saved.seq_lens_form`` its form.  Stage (4) runs the SDPA's varlen arm over
    packed ``(T, H, D)`` views in the natural tile order (a ``QsaSpec`` block
    runs the sparse core's packed arm over the same ``[1, T, H, D]`` views, the
    block ids relative to each token's sequence).  bf16 / fp16 (inference and
    training), the UNFUSED per-tensor FP8 pipeline, ``fuse_norm_rope`` (bf16 /
    fp16 inference) and block-sparse attention with caller lists are served;
    ``fuse_gate``, MXFP8 / fp4, ``seq_lens_present``, the in-block indexer and the
    paged write-through are typed declines.  Module docstring, "THD".

    **TRAINING (``save_for_backward=True``; bf16 / fp16, out of place, no fusion
    knob)** writes THROUGH the caller's :class:`SavedForBackward` instead of the
    workspace wherever the backward needs the tensor, same kernels, different
    buffers (``out`` is bitwise the inference block's)::

        (1) proj         h            -> saved.proj_slab [T, N]   (proj_slab mode)  |  workspace slab (gate-copy mode)
        (2+3) norm+rope  slab[Q],[K]  -> compact q, k (workspace) + saved.rstd_q / rstd_k  (slab columns stay PRE-norm = q_pre / k_pre)
        (3g) gate copy   slab[GATE]   -> saved.gate (compact)     gate-copy mode only; q_pre / k_pre likewise if buffers were passed
        (3b) compact     slab[V]      -> V_c
        (4) sdpa         q, k, V_c    -> saved.o (PRE-gate) + saved.lse
        (5) gate         saved.o, slab[G] -> o_gated (workspace, OUT of place)
        (6) out_proj     o_gated      -> out

    Six launches (seven in gate-copy mode), the inference chain's six.  The save
    mode is a declaration knob (``saved_gate_copy``) because the carve differs;
    ``execute`` checks the record against it -- and that ``saved.h`` IS ``h``,
    ``saved.seq_lens`` IS the ``seq_lens`` it runs with, and ``lse`` (optional)
    IS ``saved.lse`` -- before any launch (:meth:`_check_saved_set`).

        calls it BEFORE its first launch.

        The contracts:

           ``[B, S, H_kv]`` fp32 compact: the norm kernel writes them through raw fp32 pointer arithmetic over ``[T, H]``.
        2. ``saved.h`` IS ``h`` (same storage) -- the backward reads it for the projection wgrad and the Q/K recompute.
        3. ``saved.seq_lens`` IS the ``seq_lens`` this execute runs with (``is``, or both ``None``): the backward's
           declaration-time padding decline rests on this identity, without a D2H read.  Under ``thd=True`` a tensor is
           REQUIRED (it is the packed-lengths tensor the backward binds), and ``saved.seq_lens_form`` must name its form
           (``"lengths"`` / ``"prefix"`` per ``cu_seqlens``); a dense record carries ``seq_lens_form=None``.  Both typed.
        4. ``saved.lse`` is ``[B, H_q, S]`` fp32 compact; ``lse=None`` defaults to it and an explicit ``lse`` must be that
           same storage (the SDPA adapter requires an LSE tensor once compiled with one).
        5. ``saved.o`` is compact ``[B, S, H_q, D]`` in the activation dtype: the SDPA writes the PRE-gate O there.
        6. proj_slab mode (``saved_gate_copy=False``): ``saved.proj_slab`` is REQUIRED (``B*S x n_qkvg`` elements, act dtype,
           contiguous, on ``h``'s device) and becomes the stage-(1) output; ``saved.gate`` / ``q_pre`` / ``k_pre``, when
           given, must alias it exactly as :func:`saved_slab_views` spells (data_ptr, dtype, shape AND strides) -- each may
           be ``None`` here, the backward derives it from the slab.
        7. gate-copy mode (``saved_gate_copy=True``): ``saved.proj_slab`` must be ``None``, ``saved.gate`` is a compact
           ``[B, S, H_q, D]`` caller buffer the GATE band is copied into; ``q_pre`` / ``k_pre`` are copied only if given.
        8. Every caller buffer a kernel WRITES -- ``proj_slab``, ``o``, ``lse``, ``rstd_*``, the gate-copy targets -- is
           16-B aligned (:meth:`_check_saved_tensor`): they are TMA-store / 16-B vector-store targets, and a misaligned

        No allocation, no D2H read, no implicit conversion: every intermediate is
        a strided VIEW of the caller's workspace.

        ``w_q_norm`` / ``w_k_norm`` must agree with ``geometry.qk_norm`` in both
        directions (typed ``ValueError``), and so must ``saved.rstd_q`` /
        ``saved.rstd_k`` under ``save_for_backward`` (tensors iff qk_norm).

        ``h_sf`` / ``w_qkvg_sf`` (appended): REQUIRED under MXFP8 (both, checked
        for dtype / byte count / contiguity / 16-B alignment, typed), REFUSED
        otherwise.  ``w_o_sf`` (appended): REQUIRED under ``MxQuantSpec.o_fp4``
        (same checks at the format's block and scale dtype), REFUSED otherwise.

        ``saved``: REQUIRED under ``save_for_backward=True`` (the whole record is
        validated by :meth:`_check_saved_set` before any launch), REFUSED on a
        block declared without it -- an inference forward writes none of the
        record's tensors, so a silently ignored ``saved=`` would hand the
        backward an uninitialised save set.

        ``seq_lens`` under ``thd=True``: REQUIRED -- the per-sequence packed lengths
        (``[B]`` int32, or ``[B+1]`` int32 prefix sums under ``cu_seqlens=True``) on
        ``h``'s device, validated for form (never read) and handed to the SDPA for
        the Q and the KV side alike; ``h`` / ``cos`` / ``sin`` / ``out`` are the
        packed ``[T, .]`` (or ``[1, T, .]``) tensors the block was declared with.
        A training record then carries that very tensor as ``saved.seq_lens`` and
        names its form in ``saved.seq_lens_form``.

        ``block_ids`` / ``block_lens`` (appended): REQUIRED under ``geometry.qsa``
        with ``index_source="caller"`` (``block_ids``; ``block_lens`` optional),
        REFUSED on a block declared without ``qsa``.  Form checks only -- the ids
        are device data the sparse core reads (block ``b`` = tokens ``[4b, 4b + 4)``
        of the query's own sequence -- under ``thd=True`` numbered from that
        sequence's first token, ``-1`` = padding; the open tail block is always
        visible).

        ``k_cache`` / ``v_cache`` / ``slot_mapping`` (appended): REQUIRED under
        ``paged_kv_page_size > 0`` -- after norm + RoPE the block writes every
        token's post-RoPE K and V row into the pools at ``slot_mapping[token]``
        (flat slot = ``page * page_size + offset``; a negative slot writes nothing,
        the serving stacks' padding convention; a slot past the pool writes
        nothing either), then attends over its own K / V as before, so ``out`` is
        bitwise the block's without write-through.  ``index_k_raw`` (appended):
        the raw indexer key's pool, REQUIRED there iff the geometry declares the
        indexer band.  ``block_table`` / ``kv_lens`` (appended): the paged-READ
        mode's inputs -- a typed ``NotImplementedError`` until that mode lands.
        Every one of the six is REFUSED on a block declared without the attribute.
        Form checks only; slot VALUES are device data the kernel range-checks.

        ``w_iq_norm`` / ``w_ik_norm`` (appended): REQUIRED under ``geometry.qsa`` with
        ``index_source="indexer"`` -- the indexer's ``[index_head_dim]`` RMSNorm
        weights (the pre-folded ``(1 + w)`` form, like ``w_q_norm``); the block then
        REFUSES ``block_ids`` / ``block_lens`` and derives the selection itself
        (:class:`_Indexer`: the band's queries normed and rotated per token, the raw
        key mean-pooled per complete block, normed and rotated at the block start
        with the attention's own ``cos`` / ``sin``, the scorer's top-k; at
        ``S <= identity_bound`` no scorer launches and the list is the identity).
        ``index_k_compressed`` / ``block_ids_out`` / ``block_lens_out`` (appended,
        optional there): the compressed keys (``[B, >= floor(S / 4), index_head_dim]``,
        rows ``[0, floor(S_b / 4))`` written -- a cache sized for a longer context
        keeps the rest; under the identity it is the only indexer launch), the block's
        own list (``[T, top_k]`` int32, ``-1`` padded: the step-0 list a speculative
        caller reuses) and its per-row counts ``min(top_k, floor((pos + 1) / 4))``.
