"""Block compression for Qwen Sparse Attention (QSA): the indexer's key side.

QSA scores every COMPLETE block of ``POOL`` (= 4) consecutive tokens with one
compressed key ``kbar_b``.  This kernel produces those keys for a batch of
sequences in one launch (the prefill form)::

    pooled  = mean_fp32(k_raw[4b .. 4b+3, :])                          # the raw [S, 128] indexer keys
    y       = pooled * rsqrt(mean(pooled^2) + eps) * (w + w_offset)     # RMSNorm over the 128 dims
    y[:64]  = y[:64] * cos[4b] + rotate_half(y[:64]) * sin[4b]          # partial RoPE at the block START
    kbar_b  = io_dtype(y)                                               # ONE rounding

for every ``b < n_blocks_s = floor(min(seq_len_s, S) / POOL)`` of every sequence
``s``.  The HF reference pools in fp32, casts the pooled key to the key dtype,
norms with the zero-centred weight ``(1 + w)`` and rotates at the group's first
position; this kernel keeps fp32 through the whole chain and rounds ONCE at the
store -- the single-rounding contract of the block's own norm+RoPE kernel
(``qk_norm_rope.py``), whose per-row body this is with a ``POOL``-row mean
prepended.  The norm weight comes in two forms:

* ``w_offset = 0.0`` -- the weight vector already holds ``(1 + w)`` (a loader
  that folds the ``1`` in at load time; the 16-bit rounding of that factor is
  then the loader's);
* ``w_offset = 1.0`` -- ``w`` as the checkpoint stores it, the ``1`` added in
  fp32 in-kernel (HF-faithful).

Lane mapping (``D = 128``, 16-bit io): a row is 256 B and every lane moves 16 B,
so ``LANES = D // 8 = 16`` lanes cover one block -- two blocks per warp, eight per
128-thread CTA.  Per lane: ``POOL`` x ``ld.global.v4`` (one per pooled row), the
fp32 sum, the sum of squares reduced over the 16 lanes by a butterfly
(``tile_dsl.pointwise.rmsnorm_rstd``), one 16-B weight load, ``cos`` / ``sin``
loads on the eight rope lanes, one ``shfl.bfly`` per element for the
rotate-half partner (``tile_dsl.pointwise.rope_rotate_half``), one
``st.global.v4``.  Wider ``D`` falls back to several 16-B chunks per lane exactly
as the norm kernel does (``vec_chunks``).

**No mbarriers, no shared memory, no TMA, no tcgen05** -- plain LDG/STG plus
warp shuffles, so the barrier table and the SMEM table of this kernel are EMPTY
by construction; the shuffles are the only cross-lane dependency, and every
lane of a warp reaches every shuffle (a group without a block to write computes
on clamped loads and skips the store).  It runs on any CuTe DSL device.

Degenerate inputs, each with its handling:

* a sequence with fewer than ``POOL`` valid tokens (``seq_len_s < POOL``,
  0 included) -> ``n_blocks_s = 0``, nothing is written for it
  (``valid = blk < n_blocks_s``);
* an incomplete trailing group (``seq_len_s % POOL != 0``) -> never read,
  never written;
* ``S < POOL`` (no complete block anywhere) -> the host launches nothing;
* a ragged last CTA -> its groups past ``floor(S / POOL)`` clamp their loads to
  the last complete block of the batch entry (always inside the allocation) and
  skip the store;
* ``seq_lens`` entries above ``S`` or below 0 are clamped on device;
* ``out`` rows at or beyond ``floor(S / POOL)`` (a cache allocated for a longer
  context) are never written.

Bytes per launch: ``B x floor(S / POOL) x POOL x D x 2`` in and
``B x floor(S / POOL) x D x 2`` out -- 10 MiB per layer at S = 32768.  The
roofline term of this kernel is HBM bytes; no perf claim is made here until
one is measured on an exclusive GPU.

The DECODE form -- ``frost_qsa_compress_step`` and the serving contract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A decode step appends ``S_q`` tokens per sequence (one, or one plus a few
speculative drafts).  A block completes when its 4th token arrives, so the
step must compress the groups its new tokens complete, from raw keys that
partly belong to EARLIER steps.  The compressor state is a per-sequence
RING of raw keys, ``raw_key_ring [B, RING, D]`` in the io dtype:

* the ring is POSITION-indexed: the raw key of token position ``p`` lives in
  row ``p % RING`` (a bit copy of the io-dtype row; the ring never holds a
  compressed or converted value);
* ``pos0 [B]`` int32 is the position of the step's first row (``= kv_len``
  BEFORE the step; row ``j`` sits at ``pos0 + j``); ``n_commit [B]`` int32
  (optional; ``None`` = every row) is the ACCEPTED PREFIX of the step's rows:
  rows ``j < n_commit[b]`` are committed, the others are drafts awaiting
  verification and leave no trace;
* for every committed row the kernel (1) writes its raw key into the ring at
  ``(pos0 + j) % RING`` and (2) if the row completes a block (``(pos0 + j) %
  POOL == POOL - 1``) pools the block's rows -- positions below ``pos0`` from
  the ring, positions at or above it from this step's ``k_raw`` -- through
  the SAME fp32 chain as the prefill kernel (same op order: the result is
  bitwise the prefill compress of the same tokens) and stores the compressed
  key at ``out[b, blk]``, ``blk = (pos0 + j) // POOL`` (the compressed-key
  cache is indexed by block id, so a recompute of a block lands on the same
  row);
* ``compressed_slot [B, S_q]`` int32 reports per row: the block id written,
  ``-1`` = this row completes no block (or is an uncommitted draft), ``-2`` =
  the row would complete a block the compressed-key cache or the RoPE table
  cannot hold (``blk >= out.shape[1]`` or ``blk * POOL >= cos.shape[1]``;
  nothing is written -- size both for the context);
* ``RING >= S_q + POOL - 1`` (``min_ring_rows``), validated on the host: a
  completing row of this step reads ring positions down to ``pos0 - POOL +
  1`` while the step's committed rows write positions ``pos0 .. pos0 + S_q -
  1``; with that many rows no write of this launch aliases a read of this
  launch, and no committed key a later step still needs is overwritten by a
  draft (the hazard a 4-row ring has).  ``RING = 8`` serves ``S_q <= 5``.

MTP rollback contract (the two-phase commit).  Draft tokens may be rejected,
and a compressed row or a ring row written for a rejected draft would
poison the sequence's state.  The kernel therefore commits ONLY the accepted
prefix, and a serving step calls it twice:

1. at the start of the step with ``n_commit = 1``: row 0 (the accepted token
   whose K is computed in this step) enters the ring and completes its block
   if it is a 4th token -- the block the step-0 selection must see;
2. after verification with ``n_commit = 1 + accepted``: the accepted drafts
   enter the ring and complete their blocks; the rejected ones never touch
   the ring or the cache.  Row 0 is re-committed by the second call -- a
   bit-identical rewrite of the same ring row and (if any) the same block
   row, so the two calls compose to one call with the final ``n_commit``.

Under this contract every ring row and every compressed row holds a value
computed from accepted tokens only, so no rollback is ever needed; a stack
that commits eagerly (all ``S_q`` rows at the step start) must instead
recompute the blocks touched by rejected rows at the next step (the same
kernel, since a block recompute lands on its own row) and keep the ring wide
enough that a rejected draft cannot overwrite a committed key the next step
pools -- ``RING >= S_q + POOL - 1`` covers that too.  ``norm_weight_offset``
is threaded identically to the prefill form (0.0 = the pre-folded ``(1 + w)``,
1.0 = the zero-centred checkpoint weight).

Degenerate rows of the decode form: ``n_commit = 0`` (a finished sequence in
the batch) -> no ring write, no block, every slot ``-1``; ``pos0 < 0`` is
clamped to 0; a ragged last CTA computes on clamped loads and stores nothing.
