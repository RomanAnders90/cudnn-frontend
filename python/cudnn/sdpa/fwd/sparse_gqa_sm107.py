"""Adapter of the Rubin (SM107) index-list SPARSE d256 forward -- ``kernels/sm107/sparse_d256_f16.py``.

Frontend-only: the gated attention block's sparse stage (``gated_attention_block.api._SparseSdpa``, a geometry declared
with ``QsaSpec``; dense ``[B, S]`` or packed ``thd=True``) consumes it, and it stands alone for a caller with its own Q / K / V;
no graph form carries a block-index list, so there is NO engine row and NO manifest slot (an ``EngineSpec`` whose ``lower`` cannot run is a contract break).  The kernel's claims
live in ONE frozen record, :data:`SPARSE_CAPABILITIES`, spelled in the ``Capabilities`` vocabulary where a field exists, and
:meth:`SparseGqaFwdDslSm107.check_support` is the ENFORCEMENT point: the CuTe DSL version gate first (``sm_107a`` needs the
public 4.8.0 wheel; ``python/cudnn/AGENTS.md`` Rule 7 -- BEFORE the kernel module is imported, so a too-old DSL reads as a
version problem, never as a ``KeyError`` from inside the DSL), then every field of the record as a typed decline.  Every
arm the body does not carry yet (a sink, a band, Q-length trimming of a dense batch, log2 stats, a pure caller list) is declined
BY NAME; a later commit that lands an arm flips the record field, the config's wired-arm set and the support-matrix tracker in
the same change.  THD (packed sequences) and paged K / V pools are carried --
ONE of the two per declaration (``thd=True`` with ``paged_kv=True`` is a typed decline: the packed sequence's K / V row offset
composes with a dense tensor only, never with a page pool) -- and so is the fused epilogue gate, which composes with either
(it touches the item's Q^T slot ring and the epilogue only); see the contracts below.

The fused epilogue gate (``epilogue_gate=`` the gate OPERAND, O's ``(B, S, H_q, D)`` shape in Q's dtype at its own (batch,
seq, head) strides -- a slab column slice binds with no copy; the packed ``[1, T_q, H_q, D]`` form under THD) is served: the
kernel stages the item's gate tile into its freed Q^T slot and writes ``O * sigmoid(G)`` in place of O (``h * tanh(g / 2) + h``
on the fp32 value, the dead-row SELECT per element after it; the LSE is untouched).  Its presence is a MODULE specialization
(``TemplateParams.epilogue_gate``), so a gated and an ungated adapter are two compiled artifacts; a request without the
operand compiles the ungated kernel.

Paged K / V (``paged_kv=True``, the serving read): ``k`` / ``v`` are page POOLS ``[num_pages, H_kv, page_size, D]`` -- HND
compact, or NHD storage declared through the strides (the dense SDPA adapter's own paged contract) -- addressed through ONE
``block_table`` ``(B, max_pages)`` int32 (contiguous; the same table serves K and V), with ``seq_kv_lens`` REQUIRED as the
per-batch logical KV length (the pool has no dense extent: it is what bounds the visible range and what makes the rows of a
partially filled last page -- another sequence's tokens, or garbage -- never reach an MMA).  ``page_size`` must be a positive
multiple of 4 (a 4-token block never straddles a page, so the kernel does one table lookup per block); a ``-1`` table entry
and a page index past the table read as zero rows.  The kernel derives per operand from the strides: rows per page (page
stride / token stride), rows per head (head stride / token stride for an HND pool, 0 for an NHD pool whose head lives in the
column coordinate) and the column head stride -- one compiled kernel serves both layouts.  The pools' dtype is the
activation dtype (``kv_cache_dtypes``: bf16 / f16 with a bf16 / f16 Q); the block's paged-READ mode (``block_table`` /
``kv_lens`` through the gated attention block) lands with the decode form.

The DECODE FORM (``bottom_right=True`` + ``list_per_sequence=True`` [+ ``split_kv=S``]; the same kernel specialised by three
``TemplateParams`` arms, dense BSHD or paged pools, never THD): the step's ``S_q <= 4`` rows per sequence sit at the END of the
sequence (``bottom_right``: row ``j``'s position is ``kv_len_b - S_q + j``; a sequence shorter than the query count makes the
rows with a negative position dead), share ONE block list (``list_per_sequence``: ``block_ids`` int32 ``[B, top_k]``,
``block_lens`` ``[B]`` or None) anchored at the STEP-0 position ``kv_len_b - S_q`` -- the count comes from it and the appended tail
runs from the step-0 tail start to the row's own position (the block completed between step 0 and the row stays visible, its
own token included; the MTP shared-list semantics) -- and ``split_kv=S`` cuts every item's tiles into ``S`` chunks, each its own
work item writing fp32 partials into the caller's ``workspace``, reduced by ``sm100/split_combine.py`` into O / LSE as a second
launch on the same stream; a split with the gate operand compiles the UNGATED kernel and the GATED combine (``O *= sigmoid(G)``
on the fp32 merged value: ONE rounding, the fused epilogue's convention).  ``bottom_right=True`` is also served with per-token
lists (``[B, S_q, top_k]``: row ``j``'s list at its bottom-right position).  ``S`` is bounded by the item's maximum tile count
``ceil((top_k + 1) / 32)`` (a larger split has an empty chunk on every item); ``list_per_sequence`` needs ``bottom_right`` and
``S_q <= 4`` (the shared list's tail covers at most two blocks).

The device does the work (Rule 3): lengths, counts, dead items and the tail block(s) are derived on device from the position
and the per-row ``block_lens``; nothing below reads device memory.  ``execute`` validates and launches (Rule 1): no
conversion, no allocation, the caller's stream.  The kernel needs NO GMEM scratch unless split or THD
(:meth:`SparseGqaFwdDslSm107.scratch_workspace_bytes`: 0, the split partial slabs, or the THD metadata).

Two ways to bind the operands.  A standalone caller constructs with its tensors and calls ``execute()``; a caller whose
buffers exist only at execute (the block's workspace views) declares every operand as a :class:`SparseOperandDesc` -- the
shape, the strides, the dtype, the device -- and hands the tensors to ``execute(q=, k=, ...)``, where each must match its
declaration exactly (the specialization and the stride contract were validated on the declaration).  ``block_lens`` is the
one operand whose PRESENCE may differ per call: ``compile(has_block_lens=...)`` builds either variant at plan time and
``execute`` dispatches on the tensor it is handed -- never a compile on the execute path.

Stride contract (the gather map is TWO-dimensional: the tokens of EVERY batch are its rows, the token's full row its
columns): the head dim contiguous; the head stride a multiple of 64 elements (a column box start); the token stride a
multiple of 8 elements (TMA's 16-byte rule); the K / V batch stride EQUAL to ``S_kv x token stride`` (or B == 1) -- a padded
batch stride has no 2-D row coordinate; Q / O any dense (B, S, H) strides.  ``block_ids``: int32 ``[B, S_q, top_k]`` (or
``[B x S_q, top_k]``) CONTIGUOUS -- the row stride is the bulk-copy length; ``block_lens``: int32 ``[B, S_q]`` / ``[B x S_q]``
contiguous or None; ``seq_kv_lens``: int32 ``[B]`` contiguous or None (its presence is a compile-time specialization).

THD contract (``thd=True``; packed sequences, the kernel's persistent claim-counter form): Q / O ``[1, T_q, H, D]`` and K / V
``[1, T_kv, H_kv, D]`` with batch extent 1 (``T_q`` / ``T_kv`` are CAPACITIES >= 1: the live totals are device values; the
rows past them are never touched), the same per-operand stride rules; ``block_ids`` int32 ``[T_q, top_k]`` / ``[1, T_q, top_k]``
with every id RELATIVE TO ITS SEQUENCE (block ``j`` of sequence ``b`` = its tokens ``[4 j, 4 j + 4)``), ``block_lens`` ``[T_q]``
/ ``[1, T_q]`` or None, LSE ``(1, H, T_q)`` in any strides; ``seq_q_lens`` AND ``seq_kv_lens`` REQUIRED: int32 contiguous
per-sequence lengths ``[B]`` -- or cumulative ``[B + 1]`` prefix sums with ``cu_seq_q_lens`` / ``cu_seq_kv_lens`` (normalised on
device: a prefix sliced from a larger one means the same lengths) -- the sequence count ``B`` is their shape; and a
``workspace`` of :meth:`SparseGqaFwdDslSm107.scratch_workspace_bytes` bytes (16-byte aligned, on the device) for the THD
metadata the setup launch writes.  Semantics per sequence ``b`` with Q length ``S_q_b`` and KV length ``S_kv_b``: row ``pos``
sees ``n_vis = min(pos + 1, S_kv_b)`` tokens (top-left causal); ``S_kv_b = 0`` makes every row of the sequence dead (``O = 0``,
``LSE = -inf`` stored); ``S_q_b = 0`` contributes no work; a one-sequence packing computes the dense ``B = 1`` function.
Lengths are device values (Rule 3): the host validates the tensors' FORM only.
