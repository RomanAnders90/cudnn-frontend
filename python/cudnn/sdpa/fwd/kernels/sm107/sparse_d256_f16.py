"""Rubin (SM107) index-list SPARSE prefill SDPA forward -- d_qk = d_v = 256, FP16/BF16, swap-AB, gathered K/V.

HEADER FIRST: this module carries its pipeline tables (warp map, barrier table with the issuing-lane ledger, SMEM table with
swizzle + why, TMEM map, the one-helper invariant, the degenerate-input matrix) ahead of the body, so a reader checks the
body against them instead of reconstructing the pipeline from the code.  The body is built from the SM100 swap-AB decode
tile (``sm100/decode_d256_f16.py``: the MMA descriptors, the softmax orientation, the epilogue) plus the ``tma_gather4``
loader; the config twin is ``config_sm107.make_cfg_d256_sparse``.

WHAT IT COMPUTES.  For query row ``r`` of sequence ``b`` at position ``p`` with ``n_vis = min(p + 1, L_b)`` visible tokens
and the caller's block list ``ids(r)`` (``[T_q, BLOCK_TOPK]`` int32, valid prefix then -1, blocks of BLOCK_SIZE = 4 tokens):

    V(r) = { t < n_vis : floor(t / 4) in ids(r) }  UNION  { t : 4 floor(n_vis / 4) <= t < n_vis }     (the open tail block, always visible)
    O[r] = softmax_fp32(q_r . K[V(r)]^T * scale) . V[V(r)];   LSE[r] = max + log(sum)  (natural log, the exact fp32 sum)

A listed block strictly past the open one (4 blk >= n_vis) contributes nothing (masked key by key); an entry that lists the
OPEN block itself (blk == floor(n_vis / 4) with n_vis % 4 != 0) or repeats another entry is attended TWICE -- a duplicate of
the appended tail / of the other entry (the softmax over the multiset; the list contract forbids both -- the library's host
check is FORM-only and never reads a list, the test tree's ``block_ids_contract_violations`` detector is what rejects them);
-1 entries at index < count are "no key" (zero rows, -inf) and still cost fabric bytes; entries at index
>= count are never read, so an extra entry placed at index count is never read either.  count = clamp(block_lens[r], 0,
n_sel_default) when block_lens is given, else n_sel_default = min(BLOCK_TOPK, floor((p + 1) / 4)) -- a device min / max,
never a host read.  An empty V(r) (L_b = 0, p < 0, a padded Q row, an empty selection with no tail) lands O = 0 / LSE = -inf
through a SELECT on the emptiness predicate, never ``residue * inv_sum``; padded Q rows store nothing.  The position p is the
row index (top-left) or, under CFG.BOTTOM_RIGHT, row + (L_b - S_q_b) (the dense tiles' bottom-right diagonal: the decode and
verify rows sit at the END of the sequence); the DECODE FORM below shares one list per sequence anchored at the step-0 position.

WORK ITEM = (query token t, KV head h): the G query heads of t (12 at 24/2, G <= 16) form the MMA N axis of the swap-AB tile,

    BMM1  S^T[128 keys, 16] = K_tile[128 x 256] (A, K-major SW128) . Q^T[16 x 256] (B, K-major SW128)   16 k-steps of 16
    BMM2  O^T[128 d, 16]   += V^T[128 d x 128 keys] (A, MN-major) . P^T[128 keys x 16] (B, MN-major)    2 d-blocks x 8 k-steps

over n_tiles 128-key tiles, each 32 four-token blocks GATHERED by ``tma_gather4`` (one issue = 4 rows x one 128-B column box;
4 boxes per 256-wide row per operand; 128 issues = 64 KiB per operand tile).  One CTA per SM, cga1, 20 warps (16 at one softmax
column group), persistent
through the shared scheduler (BSHD: the grid is the work list, 2 x T_q items decoded arithmetically; THD: the device-counter
form on an occupancy-sized grid).  Q^T and the block list of item i+1 are prefetched under item i's KV loop; the epilogue gate
of item i (``O *= sigmoid(G)``, compiled out unless CFG.EPILOGUE_GATE) is TMA-staged into the freed sQ slot of item i.

WARP MAP (the DEFAULT = TWO softmax column groups: 20 warps = 640 threads; ONE group (TemplateParams.qsa_softmax_groups = 1) = 16 warps
= 512 threads, its ids in parentheses; every warpgroup is role-homogeneous because ``setmaxnreg`` is warpgroup-collective; the gather /
MMA / TMA / scheduler / spare ids FOLLOW SOFTMAX_WARPS -- CFG.GATHER_WARP_BASE / MMA_WARP_ID / TMALDG_WARP_ID / SCHED_WARP_ID /
SPARE_WARP_ID -- and the body dispatches on those names, never on a literal; table re-based on the two-group default 2026-10-09)

    warp 19 (15)       WG4 (3)       spare (CFG.SPARE_WARP_ID): passes the init sync, then exits (no CTA-wide barrier-0 sync may follow that one
                                     in the body)

SOFTMAX SPLIT (CFG.SOFTMAX_GROUPS = 2, the DEFAULT since its A/B/A; TemplateParams.qsa_softmax_groups = 1 renders the one-group body; a
PERFORMANCE knob -- the same function bitwise): the softmax role becomes TWO 4-warp column GROUPS, warps 0-3 (WG0) columns 0-7 and warps 4-7 (WG1) columns 8-15 of S^T / P^T /
O^T over the SAME 128 lanes (grp = warp // 4, col0 = 8 grp, lane = tidx & 127; a warp's TMEM lanes are its quadrant's, warp % 4, so warp 4
shares lanes 0-31 with warp 0 and the column offset is a plain address add); the gather warps move to 8-15, MMA / TMA-LDG / scheduler /
spare to 16 / 17 / 18 / 19.  Per tile each group loads ITS 8 S^T columns (tcgen05_ld num=8), reduces 8 column maxes through ITS slice of
``red`` ([3][8 warps][8 cols] = the same 768 B) behind ITS named barrier (2 + grp, 128 threads), packs ITS 16-B P^T chunk per lane row
(word offset 4 grp = exactly the one-group loop's chunk c = grp under the same Swizzle(1, 4, 3)), rescales ITS 8 columns of both O^T
d-blocks, and in the epilogue sums / stores ITS columns (col0 + j < G).  Every softmax-fired barrier init doubles (SOFTMAX_LANES 256,
IDS_EMPTY_ARRIVERS 16, READ_TILE_ARRIVERS 18, named barrier 1 at 288); the per-lane mask work is duplicated in both groups.  At ONE
group every split term folds away (``cutlass.const_expr(SOFTMAX_GROUPS > 1)``): the default rendering's cubin is byte-identical to the
pre-split one (28801073 ungated / ceeba558 gated, 2026-10-09).  Registers at 20 warps: 96 FLAT (65536 / 640 rounded down to 8); host
sm_107a trace-compiles of 21 two-group renderings (gated / paged / THD / split-KV / bottom-right / f16 / G = 1, 5, 12, 16 / top-4): STL 0 /
LDL 0 on 20, G = 16 gated 1 / 1 in the prologue only (vs 6 / 6 + 3 per TILE at one group, REG 128); the declared split
8 x 136 + 8 x 72 + 4 x 64 = 1920 == 96 x 20; the fallback ``gather_warps=4``: 16 warps, 128 flat, 8 x 160 + 4 x 96 + 4 x 96 = 2048.

Every warp except the scheduler credits the scheduler slot (read_tile_id_arrive) at the TOP of its item, right after reading
the payload -> READ_TILE_ARRIVERS = SOFTMAX_WARPS + 1 + 1 + GATHER_WARPS = 18 (14 at one column group).  Registers at ONE column group
(the two-group numbers are in the SOFTMAX SPLIT paragraph above): a 512-thread launch gives ptxas 128 per thread
FLAT (``.reqntid 512`` and no ``.maxnreg`` from the DSL; every setmaxnreg is dropped).  Host trace-compile of the decode body
under a forced 512-thread rendering (sm_107a): REG 104, STL 0, LDL 0 on the dense-padded and the causal specializations.  The
declared split for when ``.maxnreg`` lands: 4 x 240 + 8 x 96 + 4 x 80 = 2048 == 128 x 16 (SUM(role regs x warps) == entry x
warps; every count % 8 == 0).  The named fallback ``make_cfg_d256_sparse(gather_warps=4)``: 12 warps, 168 flat,
4 x 240 + 4 x 96 + 4 x 168 = 2016 == 168 x 12.  Every other population is declined by the config: a gather count that does
not divide the 32 blocks of a tile (5 -> 13 warps, 6 -> 14 warps) by the divisibility predicate, one that divides them but
does not fill a warpgroup (2 -> 10 warps) by the warpgroup predicate; the factory itself admits gather_warps in {4, 8} only.

MEASURED LEVERS (2026-10-08; the Rubin perf class, 212 SMs at the 2376 MHz lock, sampled 2364 MHz; A/B/A x 3 rounds x 100 launches

the real layer-3 lists and random lists; every variant bitwise-equal to this kernel's O / LSE; speed-up = shipped / variant - 1):

binds) -> 8 stands, and 12 gather warps is not a population (32 % 12 != 0; 20 warps = 96 registers flat < the 128 this body needs
at 0 spills); the L2 EVICT_NORMAL policy on the K / V gathers -0.00..-0.02 % = NEUTRAL (inside the control pairs) -> EVICT_LAST
stands; the exact live-bytes arm (expect_tx = n_live x 2 KiB per warp, the dead quads STS-zeroed by the warp's lanes instead of TMA-OOB
zero-fill) -9.5 % @8K / -10.6 % @32K -> the full-box arm with TMA zero-fill stands (that arm fences generic -> async and
warp-syncs at EVERY fill before the arrive, plus the zero stores per dead block: more gather-warp latency than the <= 4.3 % of
fabric bytes it saves are worth on a body-bound core; a fence only on fills that zeroed a quad was not measured -- the
lever's ceiling is still those bytes); a SEPARATE gate slot
(229.4 KiB, the oversized carveout) is unmeasured -- it needs the gated rendering.

BARRIER TABLE (per CTA; init = the EXACT per-phase arrival sum; "lanes" resolved from the guard form at the call site --
nothing in tile_dsl.barrier elects for you; cga1: every commit is cta_group::1, no cluster fence, no cross-CTA arrive.  The primary

Init: ``if warp_idx == 0: if nvvm.elect_sync():`` every stage of every ring (``.init()`` is per stage) + the two scheduler rings
(ONE_LANE / READ_TILE_ARRIVERS); fence_mbarrier_init + barrier_cta_sync OUTSIDE the branch.  Phase discipline: every ring
slot and parity above comes from a PipelineState CARRIED across work items in every role that touches it and advanced at
every producer fire / consumer wait -- NEVER recomputed from a per-item tile index, and never a manual ``^ 1`` flip (rows 11 / 12
included since 2026-10-09: the single-stage gate barriers' consumer parities are ``ge_state`` / ``gf_state``, advanced through
``advance(state, CFG.STAGES_GATE)`` -- a second flip site is how P14 drifts).  The decode tile's arithmetic parities
(``_kv_slot``, ``(t // 2) & 1``, ``((t // 2) - 1) & 1``) are correct only because that kernel is not persistent (fresh
barriers per unit); in a persistent CTA they HANG at n_tiles = 1 with two items (s_empty), read a stale S^T slot at
n_tiles = 3 (s_full) and read a stale K/V slot whenever 2 x n_tiles % 3 != 0.  Every item runs >= 1 tile, so the per-item
rings (1-4, 11-14) advance exactly once per item and the per-tile rings (5-10) at least once; the epilogue runs for every item.
Exit drains (every arrive has a reachable wait): the TMA warp waits mb_ids_empty x STAGES_IDS and, ungated, mb_q_empty x STAGES_Q
(pre-armed state); gated, every mb_q_empty commit is consumed by its item's gate load (nothing left) and mb_gate_empty is
drained x (STAGES_GATE + 1) = 2: n_items completions, n_items - 1 loop waits of which ONE is the pre-armed pass -> 2
unconsumed for every n_items >= 1 (n_items = 1: the first drain wait IS the pass); every gather warp waits mb_kv_empty x
STAGES_KV -- each with its carried state.  Gated arm, the slot's order: Q(i) -> MMA reads -> mb_q_empty(i) -> gate(i) ->
mb_gate_full -> epilogue(i) reads -> mb_gate_empty -> Q(i + 2); the TMA warp issues gate(i) AFTER queuing Q(i + 1) / ids(i + 1)
(their waits are the EARLY ones: mb_gate_empty(i - 1) / mb_ids_empty; the gate's is the item's LAST BMM1) and before its next
credit; the softmax warps find the item's gate at slot i % 2 through a carried qslot_state.

THE ONE HELPER ``_item_bounds``: n_tiles, count, the tail block id(s), dead and the split chunk are computed by ONE pure
helper at the item-start site of EVERY role that loops over tiles (softmax, MMA, the 8 gather warps, the TMA warp) over the
same inputs (the item ``_decode_item`` decoded from the payload -- ONE decode for every role and every item, the CTA's
first item included -- the block_lens pointer, the seq lens); nothing about them is staged through SMEM.

    live          = tok < eff_seqlen_q_b                          the store predicate (a padded Q row stores nothing; computed at the store)

A dead item's 32 block ids read as -1 (the gather and softmax lanes SELECT -1 over the loaded word, read at an address
clamped into the slot), TMA zero-fills and credits the 128 KiB, every lane is masked, l_tot = 0 and the row_dead SELECT lands
O = 0 / LSE = -inf (no store for a padded Q row) -- every ring advances exactly as on a live item.  A gather ROW coordinate
is kv_row_base + 4 blk + r for a live row (kv_row_base = batch x S_kv on the dense map, cu_k[b] under THD) and -1 (TMA
zero-fill, bytes credited) for a -1 block, a block past the sequence's length and the straddling rows of its last block, so
no other sequence's row -- or its NaN -- reaches an MMA under P = 0.  Per key lane l of tile i: blk = sIds[32 (tile0 + i) + l // 4]
(or the tail id / -1 by the SELECT), key_abs = 4 blk + l % 4, valid = (blk >= 0) & (key_abs <= pos) & (key_abs < eff_seqlen_kv_b);
s[l, j] = valid ? s_raw * scale_log2 : -inf for the 16 columns -- the open block's future rows hold REAL keys of other
tokens, so this mask is mandatory (TMA-OOB zero-fill does not do its job).

THD ARM (CFG.THD_VARLEN; the config forces SEQ_KV_LENS_PRESENT): the operands are PACKED -- Q / O [1, T_q, H, D], K / V
[1, T_kv, H_kv, D], block_ids [T_q, BLOCK_TOPK] with the block ids RELATIVE TO THE SEQUENCE (block j of sequence b = its
tokens [4 j, 4 j + 4), i.e. packed rows cu_k[b] + 4 j .. + 3), LSE [1, H, T_q] -- and ``seq_kv_lens`` is the int32 METADATA
workspace of THD_META_WORDS(B) = 4 B + 4 words the host launches the shared setup kernel (``thd_helpers``) to fill from the
caller's lengths (per-sequence [B], or cumulative [B + 1] per the lens-form bits), BEFORE the main launch on the same stream:

    [0 .. B-1] = seq_kv_lens   [B .. 2B] = cu_q   [2B+1 .. 3B+1] = cu_k   [3B+2 .. 4B+1] = remap (unread here)
    [4B+2]     = live = T_live x H_kv, T_live = cu_q[B]   (one unit per packed Q token per KV head)
    [4B+3]     = ctr  = the persistent claim counter, seeded with the grid size

so eff_seqlen_kv_b = meta[b] is read by the SAME SEQ_KV_LENS_PRESENT path as a dense per-batch length.  The scheduler takes
the persistent form (``scheduler_warp_loop_persistent``: a unit id from the counter against ``live``, published as the payload
word (uid, 0, valid, 0) through local SMEM + one elected arrive -- barrier row 13 keeps init ONE_LANE); the grid is
occupancy-sized (one CTA per SM, at most one per unit), CTA c takes unit c first, and a CTA at or past ``live`` EXITS at entry
before any mbarrier init, TMEM allocation or credit.  ``_decode_item`` turns a unit id into the item in EVERY role: head =
uid // T_live, tok_packed = uid % T_live (the token runs fastest: concurrent units are adjacent tokens of one KV head, whose
lists overlap in L2), the sequence b by a binary search over cu_q (an empty sequence can never hold a token), pos = tok_packed
- cu_q[b], eff_seqlen_q_b = cu_q[b + 1] - cu_q[b], item_row = tok_packed (the block_ids / block_lens row and the Q / O / LSE
token coordinate, batch coordinate 0), kv_row_base = cu_k[b].  No per-sequence descriptor exists: the Q map and the gather maps
span the packed CAPACITIES (T_q / T_kv rows, each >= 1 by the adapter's contract -- a zero extent is an INVALID map) and every
coordinate stays inside the live totals by construction (tok_packed < T_live; a key past the sequence's length takes row -1).
Degenerate THD rows: a sequence with Q tokens and S_kv_b = 0 -> every one of its items is dead (one -1 tile; O = 0 / LSE = -inf
STORED); S_q_b = 0 -> no unit (nothing stored); S_q_b > S_kv_b -> n_vis = min(pos + 1, S_kv_b) (the tail follows the visible
range); the capacity tail past cu_q[B] is never written and the K / V rows past cu_k[B] are never read; B = 1 packed is the
same function as dense B = 1, S = T (bitwise: the same gathers in the same order, only the item-to-CTA assignment differs).
The missed-coordinate signature of a THD port (a dense coordinate on a load: LSE exactly log(S_kv_b), constant across a
sequence) is excluded by construction -- the three load sites (the ids bulk copy, the Q box, the gather rows) take item_row /
(out_tok, out_batch) / kv_row_base from ``_decode_item`` and nothing else.

Descriptor version: the LAST MMA-operand start is sKV[STAGES_KV - 1] = 155,648 B < 262,144 -> DESC_VERSION = 0, ONE module
constant passed to every SmemTile (a version-0 descriptor's 14-bit start_address wraps at 256 KiB; version 1 is not a
transparent widening, so it is derived, never "set to be safe").  A separate gate slot (+8 KiB) or ring depth 4 (+64 KiB)
needs the oversized carveout (ALLOW_OVERSIZED_SHARED_MEMORY, L1 -> 8 kB) -- measured levers, not defaults.  Proxy fences:
after the P^T generic stores (before mb_p_full), after the once-per-CTA sQ tail-row zeroing; the TMEM path is ordered by
tcgen05_fence + the commits; the sIds bulk copy -> LDS and gate TMA -> LDS edges are ordered by their mbarrier waits.

TMEM MAP (64 columns per CTA, allocated once, is_exclusive=False -- <= 512 columns; at two softmax column groups group g touches columns
[8 g, 8 g + 8) of the active S^T slot and of BOTH O^T d-blocks -- disjoint column sets, the same 128 lanes): S^T slot 0 at [0, 16), slot 1 at
[16, 32), O^T d-block 0 at [32, 48), d-block 1 at [48, 64).  No TMEM slot is assumed zero: BMM2(0) of every item overwrites
(accumulate=False) and every dead column ends in the SELECT, never residue * 0.

GATHER TENSOR MAP: one 2-D map per operand, tokens OUTER, the token's FULL ROW inner, box (64 elems, 1 row) = one 128-B
SW128 span; the head and the d-box live in the COLUMN coordinate (h x D + box x 64; + o_k / o_v on the block's slab), every
batch / sequence / page term in the ROW coordinate (b x S + 4 blk + r; cu_seqlens_k[b] + 4 blk + r; the paged form below).
Stride contract: last dim contiguous, head stride a multiple of 64 elements, token stride a multiple of 8 elements, extents
< 2^32, page_size % 4 == 0.

PAGED ARM (CFG.PAGED_KV; a const_expr branch of the gather warps only -- the softmax, MMA and TMA warps and every barrier /
SMEM row are the dense arm's): K / V are page POOLS [num_pages, H_kv, PAGE_SIZE, D] addressed through a (B, max_pages) int32
block table; the per-batch KV length (seq_kv_lens, REQUIRED) is the visible range.  The 2-D map's rows are the pool's token
rows at the TOKEN stride (pitch = the page_size axis' stride): rows = num_pages x rows_per_page, inner = (H_kv - 1) x
col_head_stride + D.  The row of block blk's token r = page x rows_per_page + h x rows_per_head + (4 blk) % PAGE_SIZE + r
with page = block_table[b, (4 blk) // PAGE_SIZE] -- PAGE_SIZE % 4 == 0, so a block never straddles pages and ONE lookup per
block suffices; the lookup is hoisted into the gather warps' ids quad before the ring wait.  NHD pools (token stride
H_kv x D, head stride D): rows_per_page = PAGE_SIZE, rows_per_head = 0, the head in the column (h x D + box x 64); HND pools
(token stride D, head stride PAGE_SIZE x D): rows_per_page = H_kv x PAGE_SIZE, rows_per_head = PAGE_SIZE, the column box x
64 -- the adapter derives the three per-operand numbers from the strides (one compiled kernel serves both).  A -1 block, a
block whose first token is at or past the batch's KV length (its page index may name another sequence's stale page), a page
index past the table and a -1 table entry (the page -1 convention of the dense paged tiles) all take row -1: TMA zero-fill,
bytes credited -- so the rows of a partially filled last page beyond the KV length (another sequence's tokens, or garbage)
never reach an MMA, and the straddling rows of the open block are masked exactly as in the dense arm (key_abs < the length).

DECODE FORM (CFG.BOTTOM_RIGHT + CFG.LIST_PER_SEQUENCE + CFG.SPLIT_KV, each a const_expr arm; the dense rendering is unchanged):
the serving step's S_q <= 4 rows per sequence sit at the END of the sequence (BOTTOM_RIGHT: pos = tok + L_b - S_q), share ONE
block list (LIST_PER_SEQUENCE: block_ids [B, BLOCK_TOPK], block_lens [B]; item_row = b, so every item of the sequence -- every
KV head, split and token -- bulk-copies the same row) anchored at the step-0 position pos_0 = L_b - S_q (the count from pos_0,
the tail = the blocks from floor((pos_0 + 1) / 4) to the row's own block: 0-2 ids, derived, never in sIds), and at serving batch
(2 B items of <= 17 tiles each) the tiles of every item are cut into SPLIT_KV chunks, each its OWN work item: grid x = tok + S_q x
split, the softmax lanes store fp32 partials O_s = acc / l_s and LSE_s = m_s + log l_s (natural log) at the split-major
workspace batch b + s x B with the SAME st.global path as the half O (the tensor's element type is fp32), the dead SELECT per
element first, and ``sm100/split_combine.py`` reduces them (the gate, when requested, rides the combine: the kernel's own
EPILOGUE_GATE is refused under a split by the config).  An empty chunk is a DEAD item (one clamped tile of -1 rows -> O_s = 0 /
LSE_s = -inf, exactly the combine's identity), so every ring advances exactly as on a live item (P14); SPLIT_KV <=
MAX_TILES_PER_ITEM (a larger split has an empty chunk on every item).  No barrier init count, ring depth, SMEM buffer or TMEM
column changes: the per-sequence list is a SOURCE change of barrier row 3, the split a tile-range change of rows 5-10 plus the
epilogue's store target.  THD never composes with the three arms (the config refuses each pair).
MTP rows as single-token items (the shared list at S_q <= 4): every row is its OWN work item re-gathering the sequence's list --
per item IDS_TX_BYTES of ids (2 KiB at top_k 512; the copy runs for every item, dead ones included) plus (count + n_tail) x 4 rows x
2 operands x 512 B of K / V (514 blocks = 2056 KiB at a saturated list with two tail ids; 17 tiles x 128 KiB credited with the
zero-fill), so a step's bytes are S_q x the single-row step's: 2 KV heads x 4 rows x ~2.1 MiB = ~16 MiB per sequence per layer at
S_q = 4 (~4 MiB at S_q = 1), and the sequence's list row is copied S_q x H_kv x SPLIT_KV times.  The 64-wide single-item form
that would gather the shared list once is not built.

DEGENERATE-INPUT MATRIX (every row names its handling site): empty selection / pos < 0 -> dead -> one -1 tile -> the
row_dead SELECT; a query with 0 complete blocks (pos in {0, 1, 2}) -> count 0, has_open 1, the key_abs <= pos term;
(pos + 1) % 4 == 0 -> has_open 0; n_tiles in {1, 3, 4, 17} -> the carried PipelineStates; -1 inside the valid prefix -> "no
key" (blk >= 0), bytes still fetched; a block id past the sequence -> key_abs < eff_seqlen_kv_b, TMA zero-fills past the
tensor; a block violating block-causality -> key_abs <= pos (a future block contributes nothing; the open block listed inside
the count duplicates the tail); duplicates -> counted twice (contract); S_kv = 0 -> dead (one
tile, no host read); padded Q rows -> dead, no store; B x H > 1 with n_tiles = 1 -> carried states; block_lens out of range
-> clamped on device; B >= 2 / the slab stride -> the ROW coordinate carries b x S (cu_k[b] under THD), the COLUMN
coordinate the head and the column offset; one CTA / one item -> cga1 init counts; THD: S_kv_b = 0 with Q tokens -> dead items
stored, S_q_b = 0 -> no unit, the packed capacity tails untouched, a CTA past the live total exits at entry; a paged block whose
page is -1 / past the table -> row -1 (zero rows, the keys masked by the length); THD x paged -> a typed decline at config /
check_support (the sequence's row offset composes with a dense tensor only); page_size % 4 != 0, top_k outside [4, 512] or
% 4 != 0, G > 16 -> typed declines at config / check_support.  Decode form: kv_len_b = 0 -> pos_0 = -S_q -> every row dead (stored
0 / -inf; under a split every chunk dead -> the combine's all-dead identity); kv_len_b < S_q -> the rows with pos_j < 0 dead, the
rest live; (L_b - S_q + 1) % 4 == 0 -> the step-0 row has no tail and row j >= 1 one tail block (the block that completed between
pos_0 and pos_j); SPLIT_KV > the item's tiles -> the empty chunks are dead items; SPLIT_KV == the item's tiles -> one tile per item
(n_kv = 1 with B x H x S items: the carried states); S_q > 4 under the shared list, list_per_sequence without bottom_right, any of
the three arms under THD -> typed declines at config / check_support.  The denominator floor (1e-30) sits inside the reciprocal and the log only and
is always followed by the row_dead SELECT, so neither LSE nor O ever carries it.

    ``seq_kv_lens_ptr`` -> int32 [B] (read only under SEQ_KV_LENS_PRESENT).  The K/V gather maps are 2-D (tokens of EVERY
    batch as rows, the token's full row as columns), so the batch stride must be SKV x the token stride (or B == 1) -- the
    adapter validates that contract; this entry assumes validated operands.  ``gate_ptr`` (appended) -> the fused epilogue
    gate G in O's (B, SQ, QH, D) shape at its own (batch, seq, head) strides (a slab column slice binds with no copy);
    present iff CFG.EPILOGUE_GATE (a module specialization), None otherwise -- a mismatch is refused at trace time.  The
    gate takes O's form on every arm: the packed ``[1, T_q, QH, D]`` operand (batch extent 1) under THD, the dense one under
    the paged read (the gate is never paged; it composes with both arms -- it touches the Q^T slot ring and the epilogue only).

    pool whose head folds into the row), ``block_table_ptr`` -> int32 (B, max_pages) contiguous, ``paged_geom`` =
    (num_pages, max_pages, k rows_per_page, k rows_per_head, v rows_per_page, v rows_per_head); the gather maps' rows are
    the pool's token rows (num_pages x rows_per_page); SKV is the table's capacity (max_pages x PAGE_SIZE), the visible range
    comes from ``seq_kv_lens``.  On the dense arm ``block_table_ptr`` is None and ``paged_geom`` is unread.

    DECODE FORM.  ``CFG.BOTTOM_RIGHT``: no ABI change (the position offset is derived on device from the lengths).
    ``CFG.LIST_PER_SEQUENCE``: ``block_ids_ptr`` -> int32 [B, BLOCK_TOPK] contiguous and ``block_lens_ptr`` -> int32 [B] (one row per
    SEQUENCE, read by every item of it).  ``CFG.SPLIT_KV = S > 1``: ``o_ptr`` -> the fp32 O PARTIAL slab (B x S, SQ, QH, D) and
    ``lse_ptr`` -> the fp32 LSE partial slab (B x S, QH, SQ), both split-major on the batch axis (b + s x B) at the strides given
    (``o_strides`` / ``lse_strides`` are the SLABS' strides -- the adapter passes the compact ones -- and ``lse_ptr`` is REQUIRED:
    the per-split LSE drives the combine); the grid is (SQ x S, KH, B) and ``sm100/split_combine.py`` reduces the slabs into the
    caller's O / LSE afterwards (the adapter's second launch; the gate, when given, rides it).

    THD (CFG.THD_VARLEN): ``B`` is the number of SEQUENCES and ``SQ`` / ``SKV`` the packed CAPACITIES of the ``[1, T, H, D]``
    operands (batch extent 1; the live totals are device values); ``seq_kv_lens_ptr`` -> the int32 metadata workspace of
    ``THD_META_WORDS(B)`` words that the setup launch fills from ``thd_q_lens_ptr`` / ``thd_kv_lens_ptr`` (per-sequence lengths
    ``[B]``, or cumulative ``[B + 1]`` per ``thd_lens_form`` bit 0 / 1): ``[seq_kv_lens(B) | cu_q(B + 1) | cu_k(B + 1) | remap(B) |
    live | ctr]``; ``block_ids_ptr`` -> int32 [SQ, BLOCK_TOPK] (one row per packed token); ``n_ctas`` the occupancy-sized grid
    (one CTA per SM, at most one per unit) that also seeds the claim counter.  THD x paged is never rendered (a validator
